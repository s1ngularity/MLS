      " 0).I went into my bedroom and flipped the light switch. Oh, I see that the ceiling lamp is not turning on. It must be that the light bulb needs replacement. I go through my closet and find a new light bulb that will fit this lamp and place it in my pocket. I also get my stepladder and place it under the lamp. I make sure the light switch is in the off position. I climb up the ladder and unscrew the old light bulb. I place the old bulb in my pocket and take out the new one. I then screw in the new bulb. I climb down the stepladder and place it back into the closet. I then throw out the old bulb into the recycling bin. I go back to my bedroom and turn on the light switch.

I then took out some hot dogs from my fridge and brought them over to my barbecue. My barbecue is a gas barbecue, so all I had to do was press the knob and turn it to ignite it. Once I got a little fire going I put my hot dogs on the grill over it to cook. I closed the lid and left my hot dogs to cook for about ten minutes. After ten minutes I decided to check on them to see if they were done. They looked like they were cooked, so I put them all on a plate to serve to my friends. I went to my kitchen and got hot dog buns, ketchup, mustard, and relish to serve on top of the hot dogs. I laid out all of the food and condiments on the table so my friends could help themselves. We ate the hot dogs and relaxed around the table.\n",

He rides his bike through the neighborhood and tosses the papers on everyone's yards before most anyone gets up.  When I wake up on Sunday mornings, I put on my robe and put on my slippers.  I walk down the stairs and go to the door.  I unlock it and go outside to look for my paper.  I walk down the steps and I see it on the lawn, carefully wrapped in plastic, protecting it from the weather.  I grab the paper and pull it out of the plastic as I walk back up the steps and go back into my house.  I throw away the plastic and sit at the table while my coffee brews.

As a result, the house had a lot of quirks and one of which was the painting on the wall. It was not updated and did not look great. As a result, I felt that I needed to redo the paint. in doing so, I decided to get paint that was interesting to me and after purchasing the paint, I completed the paint job by myself. This was a great experience and I enjoyed painting and using primer and such and I felt that I did a great job at completing this task by myself. It was rewarding to be able to do it by myself. Afterward, my room looked great and I enjoyed seeing it look different than before. It was wonderful.\n",

I take out a pair of dress slacks and lay them out carefully over the ironing board with the legs laid out flat so they can be pressed with the iron. I turn on the iron to medium heat and take out a can of starch. Starch helps keep the pants from wrinkling, starch is almost like hairspray for clothes, keeps things from moving out of place. From there I push the iron back and forth from the bottom of the pant leg all the way up to the waist until all the wrinkles on the pants have been ironed out. Once finished with one side of the pants, I flip the pants over and iron the other side. When the pants are finished being ironed, they need to be hung up on a coat hanger so they can stay nice and pressed.\n",

He knows it is important for his dog to be able to empty his bladder and relieve himself, as well as getting exercise and walking. So, he gets up early before school, puts on his clothes, jacket, and shoes, walks outside and puts the puppy on a leash.  He takes his puppy for a walk to the front yard, and out to the street.  He also carries a bag, for cleaning up after if he needs it.  It takes Jerry about 20 minutes in the morning to let his dog walk around, exercise, and \"use the bathroom\" , but he takes a longer walk with him in the afternoon after school.  He takes him to the park, to play frisbee, and to see the other dogs in the neighborhood that play at the park.  After he walks with his dog, he feeds his dog, and gives him water to drink.  He then puts him in the back yard, and takes his leash off as usual.\n",

I made sure that the wall is clean and clear of all the nuisance. We already bought the pain and we decided the new wall pain is sky blue. My husband is putting newspaper on the floor to avoid any spill on our floor/carpet. We put tarp on the floor too before we put the newspaper. I finally start painting and it was so easy because we made sure that everything was ready before we started. It didn't take us 30 minutes to finish the whole job. We leave everything in the room except the paints, brush and other stuff that we used. We will be cleaning and removing the newspapers and tarp once the wall paint is dry.

As we sit there having our pizza, a second part of the same family came into Pizza Hut which contain about 100 people needed to be seated. A couple of tables were pulled together.

After everyone left the table, when the waitresses return they only find two dollars left on the table for there tips.

His dad paid for the pizza by giving the man on the phone his card numbers for his debit card.  Then the man gave Tom's dad a time that they would deliver the pizza.  Thirty-five minutes later, a pizza delivery guy knocked on the front door, and gave his dad  the pizza.  He signed the receipt, and gave the guy a tip, $2, for bringing it to them fast.

I picked him up and we walked into the kitchen.  I took out a bottle and added formula to it.  Then, I added some water and put the bottle into a pot of water on the stove.  I lit the stove and waited for the water to boil so it would make the milk warm for my baby.  After several minute, the bottle was just right.  I put a nipple on the bottle and tested the temperature on my wrist to make sure the milk wasn't too hot.  I sat down in the rocking chair, holding my son. I rocked him and put the bottle in his mouth.  He quickly drank his bottle.  When he was finished I put him on my shoulder and burped him.

She wet down the shower walls, and sprayed the cleaner all over the walls. Then she scrubbed them with the scrubber until all the dirt was gone.  Then she rinsed the shower walls with the shower head.  It made it easier to do, and faster.  She also got down and cleaned the bathtub as well, and sometimes on her knees, she would lean down to get the spots you have to reach on your knees.  Then once more, she sprayed the walls and the entire tub with the shower head again, until all the cleaner was off the walls and tub.  The last thing she did was use a glass cleaner and paper towels, to use it on the glass door in the shower. It made it shine after all the cleaning.\n",

When she wants something for her children, she goes online on the computer, and types Amazon.com.  The website comes up, and then she searches for the clothes she wants.  She types in \"shirts for children\" and all the shirts come up that they have to sell.  She checks for sales, and finds the sizes for her children that she needs.  Then she clicks on the ones that she likes and can afford, and she puts them in a basket online that holds her things she wants to buy. When she is ready to check out, she goes to the button that says buy, and she purchases them with her bank card information. She types it in, and then she is given a number to track the clothes through the mail to her house.\n",

My second driving lesson I had to take was downtown in the city of Minneapolis. I was very nervous because I had never driven in a big city before, and we were driving on a Friday night which I knew would be very busy. I was picked up at my house by the driving instructor and I got into the driver's seat. Our lesson started off smoothly and my instructor did not have to use her safety brake at all. However, we got into the city of Minneapolis and traffic was very heavy. I started to get nervous because of all the cars, and because Minneapolis has a lot of one way streets which makes it somewhat difficult to navigate. My driving instructor calmed me down and assured me I was doing a great job. After that, the rest of our lesson went smoothly and I drove us back to my home where my driving instructor dropped me off and left for the night.\n",

The pasta was supposed to be topped with shrimp, but when it came out it was topped with chicken!  I was disappointed.  I called the waitress over and told her what the problem was.  She was surprised because she knew she wrote down shrimp on the ticket.  She took my plate and brought it back to the kitchen.  After ten minutes, the waitress returned with the pasta with shrimp.  It looked delicious.  She apologized for the inconvenience and also offered me a free dessert.  I asked her if I could get a piece of chocolate cake.  The cake looked great when she brought it out.

I got all the meat and cut it into the right sizes then seasoned them as well. To start the barbecue, I placed charcoal and lighter fluid on a grill. While it was heating up, I made sure that all the food was ready to be cooked. I also made sure there were enough condiments, like ketchup and mustard. As I cooked the people I had invited began coming in. I put ice in a cooler, then added cans of soda and bottles of water, to make sure there was enough to drink. By now, the barbecue was heated enough to cook on. I placed the meat on the grill and watched it as it cooked on one side. After a few minutes I switched sides until all the meat was cooked fully. I cooked the vegetables, they did not take as long. Once it was ready I sat the food out for my friends to eat. I was very enjoyable.\n",

I took a frying pan from the cabinet and put a tablespoon of butter into it so the eggs would not stick.  I cracked the eggs open on the edge of a bowl one at a time, and put them into the bowl.  I threw away the shells.  I added a little bit of salt and pepper.  I used a whisk to break the egg yolks and mix the yolks and the whites together.  Once they were combined, I turned the heat of my stove on to medium.  I let the butter melt and then I added the eggs.  After they started to cook, I used my whisk to move them around so that I got scrambled eggs instead of an omelet.  The eggs got nice and fluffy.

She gathered up the mail that she had been saving for the last few weeks and thumbed through the pile.  There they were, those dreaded bills that take most of her paycheck.  There was a car payment, and a mortgage payment, and the power bill for the month.  Jenny got her check book out of her purse.  Most of her friends pay their bills online, but Jenny still liked doing it the old fashioned way.  She got her book of stamps and envelopes out of the drawer along with her pen.  She opened each bill and noted how much it would cost to pay each one.  She would have to wait to pay the mortgage next pay day, but she had enough to pay her power bill, and car payment.   The power bill was one hundred and fifty-seven dollar and thirty-nine cents.  She wrote the check to the power company, placed it in an envelope along with the payment stub.  She sealed the envelope and addressed it, placing a stamp on the right corner.  She did the same procedure with her three hundred dollar car payment.  After the envelopes were ready, she placed them in her mailbox for the mail carrier to take.  She took her checkbook and wrote the amount she had spent on the ledger. Then she subtracted it from the amount of money she had to see how much would be left until next pay day.  She would have to be very careful with her money this week, but she should have enough to get by.\n",

After remodeling one house there were many houses needed to be dry, cleaned and remodel. I was told by the supervisor that he need me to vacuum the carpet of seventy-five houses within that week. Years after, I return home and got married. My job at home was vacuuming the carpet every weekend. As today my wife and I are divorce.

It's important to wear clean clothes to stay healthy and stop bad smells. I gather my dirty clothes and put them into the washer. Detergent is the soap that goes in the washer to clean the clothes, so I put the right amount in. I turn on the washer to a good setting, which is gentle on the clothes but still gets the dirt out. After a while, the washer is finished and it's time to dry the wet clothes. I put the wet clothes into the dryer and turn the dryer on to a good setting.

I would fold the dirty diaper in half and place it in a garbage can. I would then take a baby wipe and wipe off the baby's bottom to make sure it is clean before I put a clean diaper on him. I might put a little bit of baby lotion on the baby's bottom to make sure the baby does not get a rash. I would pat the baby's bottom with a dry towel to make sure it is dry. Then I would take some baby power and sprinkle it on the baby's bottom to make sure he stays dry. I would take a clean diaper out of the package, unfold it, lift the baby's bottom up with his legs, and place the diaper under the baby. I would lower his legs and attach the front of the diaper to the back with the sticky tabs.\n",

I put a spoonful of the pulled pork in the skillet, and added a spoonful of the baked beans. The fried zucchini looked good too, so I put some of that in the skillet also. I put a cover on it so the food would heat up faster and more evenly. Before I turned on the burner, I checked to make sure the pilot light was burning. It was, so I turned the knob to start the gas flame under the skillet. I didn't want to burn the food, so I set the flame on low and stayed by the stove to check on it.

I look through them and make a list of what is on sale . I meal plan around those things . Once I have a list of what I will be cooking , I write those ingredients down along with all of the other things I want or need . I separate them by department . I put all of the dairy items together , then the meat items , followed by the produce , and so on . This makes it more efficient when I am pushing a cart through the store . Once I 'm at the store , I select my items quickly . I usually buy the same brands and often the same items each week , so I know where everything is . When I 'm ready , I go to the checkout and put it all on the belt so I can pay for it . I love grocery shopping but I hate to put it all away when I get home ! \n",

My neighbors wanted me to feed the fish and make sure that the fish tank filter was working so the water would stay clear. They gave me a key to their house and showed me their fish tank, which had 4 goldfish. The fish tank was kept on a cabinet that held all the fish food and other tools needed to keep the fish tank clean and the fish healthy. The fish needed to be fed twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. To feed the fish, I had to open the pour spout on the fish food container and sprinkle about two tablespoons of the flaked fish food over the top of the fish tank.

I decided to chop all of the vegetables so I could just pull them out and eat them during the week without having to take the time to prepare them. I put a cutting board on the counter and pulled out a sharp knife. I started by cutting up green peppers, I cut the top off and removed the seeds and cut the pepper into strips. Next I cut up cucumber, I washed it and sliced it into thin round slices. I chopped the bottom off of a bunch of celery and cut each stalk into four inch long pieces so I could dip them in peanut butter. The next vegetable I chopped was broccoli which I carefully cut florets off of the head.

I got together my favorite shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner & a towel. I wash my hair while I am in the shower. First, I put hair head under the shower head & let water saturate all of my hair. Then, once my hair is wet, I add a dime sized amount of shampoo to my hand & apply it to my hair, focusing on my scalp. Once it it all bubbly & feels clean, I rinse it out. After that, I apply a generous amount of conditioner so my hair doesn't dry out from the shampoo. I let it sit for a couple of minutes. After that, I rinse it out with lukewarm water so my hair absorbs & locks in all of the good ingredients. Afterwards, I get out of the shower, towel-dry my hair & apply leave-in conditioner so my hair will stay moisturized. Then, I proceed with styling.\n",

It is important to get the corners clean so I started at the outside of the room and swept toward the center. Then it was time to wash the floor. When I was little, my mother told me, \"Clean corners, clean floor,\" and I can hear her voice as I fill the bucket and add a little bit of cleaner to the warm water. Next I got down on my hands and knees and washed the floor with the warm, soapy water. I followed this with a rinse using only clean water. When it was done it looked so nice and I knew there were no spills from cooking anymore.

First I found our family recipe and and looked through the kitchen to see what ingredients I have. Then I made a shopping list for the items that I didn't have already. I went to the store and purchased the vegetables that I needed, and then I returned home. I started heating the broth in a big pot on the stove, and then I sliced up all the vegetables and added them to the broth. I cooked up the chicken in a pan and then shredded it into tiny pieces and added that into the pot as well. I stirred and stirred it as the veggies cooked and the ingredients blended, adding spices as I went to deepen the flavor. Lastly, I added salt and pepper when the soup was finished cooking.

I leave the omelette in the pan until the toppings are fully heated.  Everything in the omelette should be hot! Once it's ready, it's time to turn off the stove.

After just laying down the underlay, we took a short break.  Then it was time to put down the laminate.  It was hard to lock the pieces together, but it came out nicely.  We were proud of the hard work we did.  Best of all, the laminate looked so much better than the carpet ever had!\n",

I then packed shorts by folding them and putting them in a pile on top the shoes. My shirts and sundresses I folded into thirds lengthwise and rolled them up like a sleeping bag; by packing them this way they will not get wrinkled as easily and it is easy to fit more into the suitcase. I matched swimsuit tops & bottoms and folded them together. I put all of my toiletries like shampoo, sunscreen and toothbrush into a plastic bag in case they would leak and into a special toiletry bag and put that in the top of the suitcase. I added two beach towels to the very top to cover everything in the suitcase. I easily closed and zipped the suitcase and was ready to go.\n",

We had lived in northern Virginia, just south of DC, for  a number of years, but had never gone into the city itself. We didn't even drive through, or near it, unless we had to. The traffic was simply too horrible. This day though, we had a plan, we drove our car to a stop-and-park place and from there we caught a subway train into the city. We walked all over the National Mall area of the city. Took a tour of the White House, saw, but didn't climb the Washington Monument, went to the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, then we headed into the big red castle, The Smithsonian. It wasn't the first museum I had ever visited but it's the first one that really made an impression on me.

I liked the building blocks the best. Then the lady at the desk called my name and showed me to a big comfy chair. There were all sorts of different things in the room. Shiny things, pictures of white teeth, and machines. Then the dentist came in with a big smile and I knew we were going to get along just fine. The dentist cleaned my teeth and said that I had been brushing really well. She told me that candy can hurt teeth sometimes, but eating lots of healthy foods help them to be strong like the ones on the poster on the wall. After we were done cleaning my teeth, the lady at the desk smiled at me and gave me some toothpaste and a little box of floss. Then we went home. I love the dentist!\n",

I put a few drinks and bottles of water in the ice to keep it cold.  Then, I moved on to the actual food.  Sandwiches seemed like the easiest food to make, so I pulled out the bread.  The kids and I all like ham, so I made three ham and cheese sandwiches and wrapped them in sandwich bags.  I packed a reusable container with some cut melon we had the night before and grabbed a couple bags of individually sized potato chips.  I threw all the food in the container and grabbed a roll a paper towels.  When I told the kids where we were going, they were so exited!\n",

Then, I get down on my hands and knees in the dirt and begin planting the seeds. I plant radishes, carrots, and celery. Then, I water them a little bit with my yellow watering can and get up. After I finish planting the seeds, I begin weeding the rest of my garden. I look through all the aisles of plants and pick out the small weeds that I want to get rid of. Once I'm done weeding, I water the entire garden. Then, I start picking fruits and vegetables tat are ready to go into my kitchen.

I shampooed my hair thoroughly and used conditioner on it afterwards. Then, I took my soap and washed my body thoroughly. I rinsed off the soap, and then I grabbed my facial scrub. I used it on my face and made sure it was very clean. After that, I turned the hot water up a bit so it would be nice and warm. I stood in the warm water for a few minutes relaxing.

First, I drew my daughter's room and where all the furniture was. There was a twin bed in the corner, a dresser beside her bed, a colorful rug in the middle of her floor, a desk with her computer and school stuff on it, a bookshelf, and lots of pictures on the walls. Then, I drew my daughter's room and what I wanted it to look like when I was finished decorating. I drew a bunk bed with her bed on the top bunk and storage space underneath against the far wall, her dresser next to the window, the rug in the middle of the floor, her bookshelf where it was before, and newly painted walls with her favorite pictures hanging on the walls. I removed the furniture and pictures and belongs. I covered the floor with plastic, so the paint wouldn't get on it. I painted her walls pink. I let the paint dry. I placed a new rainbow-colored rug in the middle of the room, assembled the new bunk bed, and put her dresser and bookshelf and belongings back in her room. She loved her new room.\n",

Most of them tell you about the washer and dryer, but some of them say not to iron, so watch out! First, we got out the ironing board and put my shirt around it. We put water in the iron and plugged it in, waiting for it to heat up. Then, we carefully laid the iron on the shirt and moved it around. The wrinkles just disappear. We had to move the shirt around to get the wrinkles in different parts. After that, we just had to do the same process on the rest of the laundry. Some clothing needs to be steamed instead. There is a button on the iron that lets out hot steam, like a trigger. Its important to have the iron set on the right settings for the piece of clothing you need.\n",

We planned out what kind of wood we were going to buy and decided to go to the hardware store to ask for some help.  A worker there suggested that we get rosewood flooring and so we decided to shop in that store for other tools we might need, such as hammers.  We bought the wood at a lumber store and took it back to our house.  Over the course of a few days, my wife and I took out the old wood.  We hit it with hammers and broke it to pieces.  We threw them away.  Than we placed the new wood down and began to put it in.  When we were done, we painted some varnish on it so that it would stay nice and solid for years.\n",

We first looked at some online sites for the best brands and colors. Afterwards we waited to get the packages. The paper was a nice blue color. We started at about ten in the morning. We set this time and day because it was our day off and we could spare the hours needed to complete the task. It took us about three hours to complete. We started from the top of the walls and worked our way to the bottoms. As we worked there was a sense of accomplishment and we believed the room was coming together quite nicely.

Usually the audience at a theater is dressed nice even though there is not dress code. Because of this I was sure to wear nicer clothes the evening of the show and made sure my hair looked good. The show began at 7:30 pm so I arrived at 7:00 pm so that I had enough time to buy a ticket and find my seat. The stagehand dimmed the lights so I knew that it was about to begin. The curtain went up and I sat back and enjoyed the show. During the right moments, I clapped to show my appreciation. After the show the actors took a final bow and I cheered some more.

Then I find the battery cover opening - this will usually be on the bottom or back of the clock but could be on the sides also.  The opening is usually like a compartment with a tab that I can push on to release the battery cover to expose the batteries.  Once I see them, I determine if I have replacement batteries or not.  If I don't, I might run to the store or order them on line if I am not in a hurry to replace the batteries. Once I have the batteries, I remove the old batteries by either pushing against one end so the other end presses down on a spring and I can pull it out, or sometimes there is a ribbon underneath the batteries that I can pull to release the batteries.  I check carefully which way the batteries go, making sure the plus sign on the battery (the knob end) goes towards the plus sign on the clock battery compartment.  Once all the batteries are in, I make sure the clock is on (plugging it in if needed) then I use the time buttons to set the correct time, making sure if there is a morning/night (a.m. / p.m.) indicator, I have it set correctly.  Finally, I use the clock buttons to set the alarm time (again making sure the a.m. / p.m. indicator is correct) and turn on the alarm by setting the switch to \"alarm\" or \"radio\".\n",

I got on my knees and looked for weeds to pluck. Weeds are plants that I don't want in my garden, that can make the plants I do want sick. I pull out all the weeds I can find, and it's hard work. Then, I water my plants. I spray all over the garden with my hose, making sure not to give my plants too much water. Then, I check if my plants are ready to pick. I see my tomatoes and peppers are looking very ripe, so I pick a few to take inside with me. Once I'm done, I wipe off all the dirt from my clothing and go back inside.

First, I wiped down the sides of the tub, which for some reason always seem to collect blue lint from my towels. Then I ran the water in the tub to rinse down the bits of dirt and sand that were lingering in the back of the tub. Since I have short hair, thankfully I didn't have to pull hair out of the drain, like I sometimes had to do when I had roommates. I turned on the bathroom fan to circulate the air while I cleaned. I pulled the bathmat out of the tub and grabbed a sponge from under the sink. I wet the sponge and poured shower cleaner onto it. Then I knelt down and scrubbed the bottom and sides of the tub, running the water to rinse everything down. Then I rinsed out the sponge and ran it over the walls to clean them, although they were not as dirty. I rang out the sponge and set it on the side of the tub. I left the fan running while the tub dried out but turned off the light and left the room.\n",

I ordered a steak, medium rare with a baked potato and a Diet Coke.  Jill ordered salad with shrimp and a lemonade.  The waitress must have been new because she messed up the orders.  First, she came out with two Sprites.  Jill and I told her politely that we ordered different drinks.  The waitress came back with the correct drinks and we placed our orders.  When our food came out, my steak was rare and Jill had chicken in her salad instead of shrimp.  Jill waved down the waitress and explained we had a mix up.  The waitress apologized and took our food back.  After about fifteen minutes, she came back with our meals.  I cut into my steak, and it was done as I had ordered it and Jill's salad had shrimp.\n",

I gather my clothes and took them down stairs. I was all out of detergent and fabric softener. I went to the the store to purchase detergent and fabric softener. I return home put my clothes in the washer. I forgot the Clorox for my white clothes. I return to the store, got my Clorox and went home. I went up stairs, shortly I felt tired and felt asleep. I awake two hours later. I heard a noise down stair. I went down stairs to check on my clothes. My friend was down stairs folding my clothes. She had a load of my white clothes washing.

I know it must be in the dirty laundry. I decide to do all of my dirty laundry, so that I will have more clothes to wear. I walk into my room and empty the contents of my laundry basket. I sort the clothes by light colors, dark colors, and whites. I pick up the pile of light colored clothes and take them to the laundry room. I hit the button on the washer that says \"start.\" Water begins to flow into the washer. I insert my light colored clothes into the washer. They fill the container halfway and are starting to get wet from the water. I grab the laundry detergent from the shelf above the washer. I squeeze the soap into the washer and on my clothes. I close the lid of the washer. I change the setting on the washer from \"large\" to \"medium\" for load size. The heat level is set to warm. The cycle is set on regular. I wait an hour until that load of laundry is done. Then I remove my light colored clothes from the washer and put them into the dryer. I add dryer sheets in with them, so that lint does not stick to my light colored clothes. I wait an hour and a half until my clothes are dry. I remove my lighted colored clothes from dryer, fold them, and put them in away in my drawers. I then repeat this process for my dark colored clothes and white clothes.\n",

They cleaned my teeth and it did not take long. The dental hygienist was very friendly. When the dentist came to review my teeth, he said my teeth were healthy but I need to make sure I floss regularly. He said I should floss at least once a day. I agreed that I need to be better about flossing. Then the hygienist gave me a new toothbrush and toothpaste and I went home. I'm glad I don't have to go back for six more months.\n",

First I fold the clothes from the previous wash because they normally stay in the basket until it's time to wash again. Once the clothes are all folded and picked up. I take the dirty clothes basket from my bathroom and wash the first batch of clothes which includes me and my husbands clothes. I run the water and add the detergent. I then put the clothes in the washer and close the lid. Once they are done, I take them out and put them in the dryer. I then turn the dryer on. I then start running the water in the washer again, adding more detergent. I then go get the dirty clothes basket from my daughters' bathroom. I bring it to the laundry room and add their clothes in the washer. Once the dryer is done with me and my husbands clothes. I take them out, hanging up the things that need to be hung and putting the rest in the clean clothes basket. I take my daughters' clothes out of the washer and put them in the dryer.

Neither of us wanted to spend a lot of money, so we thought it would be a good idea to rent a movie. I used my cell phone to look up the nearest Redbox, and we drove together to the Redbox location to pick out our film. As soon as we got to the Redbox, we started scrolling through the movies that it had available. I didn't want to watch a horror movie and my boyfriend didn't want to watch an action movie, so we decided to pick a drama film instead. We settled on a movie that had just recently won an Oscar for Best Picture that neither of us had seen yet. We paid for the Redbox using my credit card and drove back home. As soon as we got home, we made some popcorn and started the movie. Unfortunately, neither of us enjoyed the film and thought it wasn't worth all of the hype we had heard.

Next, I pressed the big, green button on the front of the phone labeled \"answer\" and put the phone up to my ear. I said \"hello\" and my friend responded \"hello\" right back. We had a good little chat about the weather and what we were going to do that day, then we both said \"goodbye\" and I hung up by pressing the big, red button the front of the phone labeled, \"end call\". Then, I put the phone back down onto the counter and went to finish getting ready for work.\n",

I sprayed the cleaner on the bathtub, the tile walls around it, the toilet and the sink, making sure I also sprayed the handles of the faucet.  With a little of the cleanser on a rag I started by wiping down the area around the light switches and the door handles.  Then I closed the drain for the bathtub and ran in a little hot water.  With the rag I used the hot water and cleanser to clean the ring off from around the tub and go around the edges to get all the soap build up off.  I wiped the rag up the walls several times to get the soap build up off of them, too.  Then I drained the tub and used more hot water to rinse the tub and walls with the rag.  I did the same with the sink, and then the top and back of the toilet.  I used the toilet brush to do the inside of the toilet and around the seat and underneath and then flushed it all away. The floor was tile, so I used a mop with a special disinfecting wipe on the head to go over it.  As a finishing touch, I use a little glass cleaner and polish all the faucets, and clean off the mirror.\n",

      " 68).A few weeks ago I decided that it was time for me to get a hair cut . Normally it is recommended to get a hair cut every six months , but I had gone quite a bit longer . The ends of my hair were splitting , and my bangs were getting longer than I liked them to be . I decided to go back to Great Clips , which is a chain that has a location near where I live . They do not require an appointment , although you can check-in online ahead of time , so I decided to walk in . I drove to the location and found a parking place easily , and there was only one or two other customers there at the time . I walked in and gave my name , and they had a record of what I had done at my previous visits . The woman who took my name and I told her that I wanted a shampoo and a hair cut . She said that she could start right away and led me to a section where I could leave my phone and wallet . I put those down , and followed her over to the chair for the shampoo . It was very relaxing and did not take much time . We then went back to her section and she asked what I wanted done . I explained I just wanted about an inch taken off of most of my hair , but my bangs to be cut so they were more above my eyes again . We did n't really talk much while she was cutting my hair , and it took her less than ten minutes . I did not want my hair blow dried , so she left it wet . I went back to the front of the shop with her to pay , and I also made sure to leave her a tip . I left the shop and was very pleased with my hair cut . \n",

Because my destination was so many miles away, air travel was the only practical way to go. I opened up my laptop so that I could look up the phone number of a travel agent. I found the name and phone number of a travel agent in my area. I called the agent on the phone. The travel agent asked me questions about the dates of the trip I wanted to take, where I wanted to go, and information about my starting destination. In a few moments, the travel agent offered me some choices about flights I could take, and accepted my payment information. The travel agent also told me many details about my destination, and advised me about some items that I should pack, and which items I should not take with me. I paid for my flight reservation and the small fee for the travel agent's services using my credit card. There were a few questions about my payment details. My tickets are electronic, and arrived in my email immediately. The whole process took less than fifteen minutes to complete. It was easy to do.\n",

Soup can be made with a lot of different ingredients, but I'm going to make a simple vegetable and chicken noodle soup tonight. Once I get out my vegetables, I chop them and put them into a big pot to cook. It's important to cook your vegetables first, so you can get the best smells and flavors out of them. Once they're cooked, I add broth wait for it to boil before I add the rest of my ingredients. When the broth is boiling, I put in chicken and noodles and let it simmer. You don't want to boil the broth for too long, because the food inside could get burned. When it's done, I take a ladle and fill up a bowl with my soup. Time to eat!\n",

But if I did that my electricity might be turned off for not paying the bill. I went inside and opened all the envelopes. Each bill was a different amount. Some bills are the same every month. This month the electric bill was much higher than I thought it should be. I thought about calling the electric company. But I remembered on day I left all the lights on at home all day while I was at work. So I figured that is why that bill was so much. I payed my bills online.

This needs to be done often with my baby.  First, I went to the basement and get a diaper from the box of Huggies diapers I bought at the store, a bottle of baby powder, and a wipe.

The other day we noticed that there were some pretty large fish, large enough that the ducks shyed away from them.since the ducks were on the far side of the pond we decided to feed the fish that had gathered in a small school near the park entrance. The kids sat on the grass while I took my backpack off and opened it up. I took out a bag of stale bread and began breaking it into small pieces and handing them to the kids. The kids tossed pieces in one at a time, closer and closer to the edge in an attempt to lure the fish closer to them. The ducks watched, enviously from across the pond.

Next I get the bottom sheet. I use a fitted bottom sheet. A bottom fitted sheet has elastic on the corners to kind of like hook around the corners of the bed. Sometimes getting the last corner on is hard because the sheet will be tight. Next I get the top sheet. This is the easy part. I unfold it and spread it over the top of the bed. Then at the foot end of the bed I push the sheet in between the top mattress and the box springs. And I do the same thing for the sides of the sheet. This helps the sheet to stay on the bed. Then I do all this again next week.\n",

We will have a picnic , eat some food and drink a few beers , play frisbee and toss around a football and at some point , we will plant trees off to the side of the park . We will plant these trees in an effort to promote environmental sustainability , and to do our part as one in a millions ' chance to help the environment . Damage is being caused to the environment and local ecosystems at an alarming rate and we should all join together to do what we can in promoting awareness and getting the word out that we need to change our ways to help protect our environment .

There was a woman out in the ocean that was finding it hard to swim back to the shore when there was too many waves hitting the beach.  I got out my phone and dialed the number 911.  When the person on the other side answered, I told her what was happening and asked for someone who could swim out to save her if I couldn't.  They told me to stay calm and don't do anything that would put my own life in too much danger.  The police sirens were heard just a little bit after and they were driving fast to the beach.

However, this year, I decided that I was going to vacation in their area. As a result, I first bought plane tickets and planned my luggage and times, called out of work for the days that I vacationed, planned a rental car, and then went there. I had a great time and was able to see many family members that I hadn't seen in years. It was an enjoyable experience and not only did I get to see family that I do not get to see often, but I also got to swim and experience the lovely hot weather of Florida. It was so much fun and I wanted to stay even longer. I had to fly home a week later though unfortunately.\n",

I drove home from the store and cleaned my kitchen to begin preparing the meal. I cut the vegetables first and began steaming them in a pot on the stove. Meanwhile, I began to cut the salmon on the cutting board. Once it was sliced into four good pieces, I started up my charcoal grill. Once it was hot, I put the salmon on the grill one slice at a time and cooked it until it was sufficiently cooked through and as done as I wanted it. Around the same time, the vegetables finished cooking. I took all of the wood and put it onto a plate. Then, I took it over to the kitchen and ate at the kitchen table.\n",

We stayed at Planet Hollywood, in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. The day we arrived, we went straight to gambling, while drinking some cocktails. After a few hours, we decided we really wanted to go out dancing that night.

We went and got all dressed up in dresses and heels, took a cab and went to the club. We got in quickly, since we were on the guest list.

I also found some thread that was the same color as the thread that was on the other buttons on the shirt.  I threaded a needle, tied a knot at the end of the thread, and began sewing the button onto my shirt.  My mom thought I did a good job.

Usually soaking dishes before washing them is a good idea. After soaking them I usually wash the easy to wash dishes first leaving the other dishes to soak and hopefully clean off better. After the easy dishes are done I move to the harder dishes like ones with crusty egg on them. These dishes take a lot more scrubbing and may take a few tries to clean off. After I am done with the dishes you put them in the separate sink to dry off. If you would like you could also take a clean dry towel to dry the dishes. After the dishes are dry you may leave them in the sink or put them back in the cabinets or wherever you keep them.\n",

The first thing I had to do was pull the old wallpaper off of the walls. I put newspaper down on the ground in the bedroom so that there wouldn't be a big mess anywhere, and began pulling. I was able to pull the wallpaper off in very large sheets, except for a few spots where the paper was very sticky and stuck to the wall. I used a solution to get the remaining glue off of the walls, and waited for everything to dry so I could come back the next day and put the new wallpaper up. The next day, my boyfriend and I worked together to peel the back off of our new paper to expose the adhesive, and we carefully pasted it on the walls in the bedroom. We used a tool to flatten out any air bubbles that we saw. It took us four hours to wallpaper the whole room. We were satisfied with our work when we were done.\n",

But if we do only that, they end up being all over the place, and someone might walk on them, or they might get lost under the bed or the couch. And next time we want to play with them, we cannot find them. That is why after playtime is over, it is important to take a little bit of time to put the toys back together, and have a space especially for them. It is a good occasion to see which ones are broken or need a little bit of cleaning that can be done with adults.

I took some fish out from the freezer and set it in the sink inside a bag to thaw. I did not want to wait a long time to eat, so I ran warm water over the frozen fish in the bag to thaw it faster. After a while, the fish was not frozen anymore and I turned the water off. I got out a large frying pan and set it on the stove burner, and set the heat on medium on the stove. I poured some olive oil into the pan to make sure the fish wouldn't stick while it was cooking, and set each of the pieces of fish into the pan. After waiting for the fish to cook enough, I poured lemon juice on each piece of fish to give them more flavor. The fish was now done and I was ready to eat.\n",

We started with the bathroom that is part of our master suite. My husband started by removing the outdated tile and flooring in the bathroom and I choose a beautiful tile and flooring to replace it. I then found a beautiful paint color to make the bathroom feel more open and bright. We painted the bathroom and changed the fixtures along with all the accessories. The result was satisfying, so I tackled my closet and redid the whole closet. I reorganized the whole closet and added shelves. Then we started to remove the bedrooms carpet and put a new carpet; which was a task that took us two whole days. We had never installed carpet before but it was fun. I painted the walls to match the bathroom and added the finishing touches to the walls. My husband changed the lighting in the room and moved in all the furniture. It took us five whole weekends to finish the room, but the end result was worth it. I love my renovated bedroom. Now, I told my husband the kitchen is next.\n",

When the day came I drove to the dentist office, making sure to arrive a little before the time of the appointment. There was quiet music playing in the waiting room; but the chairs were not very comfortable. I waited, dreading the teeth cleaning(it is never my favorite). After about 10 minutes, a dentist assistant in a white coat came to show me to a chair. The dentist, smiling, greeted me and tipped the chair back. He used a tool with a small mirror and a pick to look at my teeth. Next he used a small whirring brush and water to wash and rinse my mouth. After each rinse, he directed me to spit in a small sink on the side. When my teeth were finally cleaned(and tasting like metallic toothpaste), I was released to go to the front desk, where I paid the white coated receptionist.\n",

When they answer the phone, we give them our order for multiple pizzas. We have to tell them what size pizzas we want as well as the toppings. They also always ask us if we want thin or thick crust. We typically order multiple pizzas so that everyone can have their favorites. After we've told them our order, the employee on the other end of the phone will give us a total and tell us approximately how long it will be until our pizza arrives. When the delivery driver arrives, he rings the doorbell and reminds us of the total. We pay him and add a little extra for a tip, and he gives us our pizzas to enjoy for movie night.\n",

I purchased a nail gun, some nails, some work gloves, a table saw, safety goggles, and some need pads. I then went home and into the room where I was going to lay my new floor. I measured the length and width of the floor so I could know exactly how many pieces of flooring to cut for my new floor. I then proceeded to cut the appropriate number of pieces of flooring. I laid out the tiles on the floor and nailed each tile into the floor. When I was finished I vacuumed and dusted the floor and laid down a lacquer finish so the floor looked nice and new.\n",

Before I left my house, I had to put on a good pair of shorts and shirt.  I wanted to be comfortable and cool.  After I put on my clothes, I drove down to the court where he was waiting.  My brother went over all the rules and then we did a few stretches together.  I didn't have any tennis equipment, so he brought me an extra racket.  We played a couple of easy games and he was easier on me than he should've been.  I still lost because I was in bad shape.  It was fun, but I was so sore the next morning.

I grabbed the knot and pulled the bag out of the container and handed the bag to a co-worker to dispose of. Next I had to replace the bag I removed. I found a replacement bag in a box nearby. I took out a bag, opened it up, and inserted it into the can. I had to stick my hand in and open up the bag more when it was in, because it was sticking to itself.

We grabbed a trowel, a rake and a hoe and headed into the back yard to begin the work. It had been a while since anyone had touched the garden plot, so it was full of weeds! We got to work pulling out all of the pesky grass and flowers. There were even some dandelions! (I might have blown the seeds of those back into the garden. Don't tell anyone, please). After the garden plot was weed-free, we turned over the soil using the rake and the hoe. Once the soil was nice and loose, we grabbed the seedlings that we had started in the basement. They were in little containers. First we planted the tomatoes in a row, digging a little hole for each plant, tapping down the soil, and then moving onto the next row. Next we planted the cucumbers, and finally we ended with a couple of pumpkin plants. After all of the plants were in the ground, we watered them with the hose, being careful not to drown them.

All of that took about 10 minutes 15 minutes later, I added fabric softener to the washer and reclosed the lid. After the washing was done, I placed the wet clothes into the dryer and closed the door. I cleaned the lint filter, and started the dryer.

The first thing I did was to separate all of my white clothes for the first load in the washing machine. I put both laundry detergent and bleach in the machine because it's harder to get white clothes clean again. I also wash the white clothes in hot water. After about an hour these done and ready to be put in the drier. I put the clothes in the drier for about 45 minutes and then started the next load of color clothes. I used detergent again but cold water and no bleach. By the time this load was finished the white clothes in the drier were also ready to come out. I put the white clothes on my bed to fold and put the color clothes in the drier. That took about 45 minutes as well. After these were finished I took those clothes out and folded them or put them on coat hangars. It took about two hours total for me to do all of my laundry for the day.\n",

We stood there conversing for around fifteen minutes. The topic of us being hungry came up, and I asked him if he liked grilled cheese. He did, so I whipped some up. We both thoroughly enjoyed them. After we ate lunch, we went into the living room. I flipped the light switch on. There was a painting my wife and I had bought, it was fifteen feet long and five feet tall. Because it was so large, it was also heavy. This is why it required Jim's help, even my wife couldn't life it properly while helping me attach the wire in the back to the nail on the wall.

It was loud and had a familiar ding dong sound that you could hear from everywhere in the house. I wondered who it could be. I did not have any visitors coming over, at least that I knew about. I wondered if it was a friend. Since I did not know, I went over to peek through the eye hole in the door. I could see them safely and they couldn't see me through the hole, so they did not know I was there. I did not know this person. They were dressed up nicely in a suit and was holding some papers and a clipboard. I guessed this person was trying to selling me something. I did not have any money to buy anything, so I opened the door and told the salesman that I was not interested politely. They smiled and said they were sorry to bother me and then left.\n",

I knew there was a gas station with a decent price a mile down the road, so I drove straight there.  I pulled into the gas station, and I noticed that the outside pump was available.  This was lucky because the fuel cap for my car is on the driver's side, and I could easily pull into the station in the right direction.  I parked my car next to the pump with the gas cap next to the handle.  I turned off my car.  Got out, and as I did, I released the gas cover via a switch under the driver seat.  I pulled out my debit card, and I inserted it into the payment center.  I followed the instructions on the screen to enter my PIN.  When the screen said ready to fuel, I removed the nozzle, and inserted it into my gas tank.  I pulled and held the handle until it clicked off automatically, meaning that my car was now full of gas.  I returned the nozzle to it's cradle, put my gas cap back on my car, closed the gas cover with a click, and I got into my car and drove away.\n",

Upon arriving there, I met with the instructor, who informed me that he was going to be conducting the  lesson. He then sat beside me as I begun to drive the car. He then helped me and gave me pointers as I drove. He noticed everything that I did and attempted to help me. He was very nice and didn't say anything in a negative or mean way. Instead, he attempted to remain positive while helping me. This was an experience in which I had a lot of fun and also learned at the same time.

I had to see which ones needed certain levels of care , look up different tree diseases , and the prices of some trees . I had to find something that would work well in my yard . When we finally picked a perfect tree , we had to take it home . It was very heavy ! Once we had it home , we had to dig a very big hole . After you roll the tree into the hole , you have to do something called facing the tree , which means you put the tree in the position you are happy with the already existing branches growing . You do n't want a huge branch going right toward your house ! To make facing easier , you should fill the hole halfway with water before putting the tree inside .

We have a beach house, which overlooks the ocean and even has a pool in the yard. Two mornings ago, on July 3rd, we woke up early and packed everything into our Jeep Cherokee. We packed beach towels, lots of sunscreen, beach chairs, buckets and shovels, umbrellas, snacks, water, swimsuits and whatever else we needed for the week. We drove about two hours or so, from our home to get to the beach. Upon arriving, we unpacked our Jeep and first visited our beach house. At our beach house, we grabbed our beach toys and a volleyball net and went down to the beach where our parents could watch us from the porch of the house.

The driving instructor and I arranged a time when he would come to my house and pick me up for my lesson. Once he arrived, he taught me about all the tools and features of the car that I would be driving for my lesson. We decided to have my first lesson in the neighborhood that I lived in. I learned how to properly accelerate, brake and use my turn signals. He also taught me how to back the car up and park. We practiced parallel parking until I felt like I was really comfortable performing it. He instructed me on the importance of using the rearview and sideview mirrors. He also taught me the importance of using the emergency brake. We then discussed the importance of staying focused while driving and how becoming distracted can be dangerous. I learned a lot in my first lesson and we arranged a time for my second lesson the following week.\n",

My grandma always said that it made her sad that people never sent handwritten letters before, so I decided to write a thoughtful, handwritten letter to her and send it in the mail. It took me a very long time to write my letter because I care about my grandma so much, and I wanted to make sure the letter was perfect. After I was satisfied with the letter, I put it in an envelope and sealed it. I wrote my grandma's address on the front, my address in the top left corner, and went to look in my purse for a stamp. However, I realized I was completely out of stamps! I checked my watch and saw that it was 4:15 in the afternoon, and our local post office closed at 4:30. I jumped in my car and drove to the post office just in time to buy my stamps. I put a stamp in the corner of the envelope and dropped it off at a mailbox at the post station. My grandma received her letter three days later and said she loved it!\n",

My mom decided to order a pizza because it was something we could grab and eat on the way. First, she asked us whether we'd like pizza from Pizza Hut, Papa John's or Domino's. We picked Pizza Hut. She called and they picked up on the second ring. The worker asked what we would like. Mom ordered two large pizzas: one plain cheese and one pepperoni. Then she was asked if we'd like any drinks or breadsticks to go with it. She said yes to breadsticks and no to the drinks. Then we were told our order would be delivered in about 30 to 45 minutes. Mom hung up and told us to get ready to go. 30 minutes later, the pizza delivery person knocked on the door. Mom answered and gave him the money for the pizzas.

This book was written by a well-known movie critic and had all of his movie reviews from the past decades. He even reviewed movies from before he was born. We had been waiting for this book to arrive. My wife was all a twitter. It was a Thursday when the doorbell rang. Our door bell doesn't ring often, and it when it does, we don't often answer it to avoid uninvited solicitors. I peeked out the window though and I saw the mail truck. I knew what it was so I ran, I didn't walk, I ran up the steps to answer the door. I didn't think I'd need to sign for the package but I Wanted to make sure the mailman didn't just take the package back. I threw open the door with a huge smile on my face and greeted the mailman. He smiled back and told me he had a package for us. I opened the screen door, he handed me the package, I said thank you. He said have a nice day, turned and walked away. I closed the door and rushed back downstairs to give the present to my wife.\n",

I opened the cupboard and found a small saucepan.  I went to the fridge and took out the milk I had.  I measured out one cup and poured it in the sauce pan.  I put it on the stove and turned it on to medium heat.    I took out a whisk and stirred so the milk didn't burn at the bottom of the pan.  I kept stirring for about 5 minutes.  Then, I turned off the stove and took out a cup from the cupboard.  I poured the milk into the cup and sat down at the kitchen table to drink it.  It was absolutely delicious!

I needed to make sure that I had enough clothing to last until I came home, so I packed my old, brown suitcase to take along with me. First, I took my suitcase out of the closet and set it on the bed. Then, I went back to the closet and decided which clothes I would want to take with me. I choose 5 different pairs of pants, 5 matching shirts, 5 pairs of socks, and 5 different pairs of underwear. I also picked out a couple t-shirts and my favorite belt. I took all of this clothing over to the bed and placed the items into the suitcase, one by one. Putting the clothes into the suitcase was a little like doing a puzzle. I had to make sure that everything I picked out would fit, so I was very careful to arrange things properly. When I had all the clothes placed into the suitcase, I shut the lid and went to get ready for my trip.\n",

Once at the museum, we stood in line for our tickets.  We got a discount for being students and being in a group.  The inside of the museum was amazing.  There were exhibits on dinosaurs and on mummies.  My favorite was the exhibit on World War II.  There was a replica of a tank and a fighter plane in the museum.

After doing this,  I walked to the tennis court with my grandfather and started to play. We first just hit the ball around, then practiced serving, and finally played a game. We gave each other advice and tried to play as serious as best as we could. It was a fun experience and we both felt that we were getting a good workout, while also playing the sport well.

I went up the counter where a museum employee was sitting and talked to them. They told me how much it cost to enter and I paid them. They put a stamp on my hand so if I wanted to leave and return I could do so by showing them the stamp, and told me I could now enter the museum to look around. I started by exploring the bottom floor first. I saw the dinosaur exhibit where there were big dinosaur bones and drawings of what the dinosaurs looked like.

I also bought buns, condiments and some paper plates. I brought them home and started warming up the grill. My friends came over one by one, and soon enough, everyone was there. We put the meat on, and everyone started commenting on how good it smelled. While everything was cooking, I put paper plates and silverware on a table next to the barbecue. I placed condiments there as well, and got some paper towels for everyone. Once the meat was done, I put it to the side and let everyone make their own dish. Everyone talked about how good everything tasted, and a few people even complimented my cooking skills. Once everyone was full, we cleaned up and everyone went home for the night.

Since my parents were the land-owners , they said yes . I made sure to plant it far away from the house and any piper or wires . That way , when it grew larger , it would not be dangerous . I decided to plant a pine tree . They are not as messy in the fall , because they have needles that they keep instead of leaves that they shed . I bought a small sapling at a store . Growing a tree from a seed is more difficult . I dug a hole in the ground wide enough to hold the roots well and about 4 inches deep . I gently removed the tree from its container and placed it into the hole . Then , I covered the hole back up with soil and watered the tree .\n",

I fluffed them up by spreading them in the air and then laying it over the top of the bed.  I leaned over the bed and tucked in one end of the blanket into the other end of the mattress.  After the bed corners were tucked in, I replaced all of the pillows that I took off for the blanket.

I then grab a non stick pan, preferably teflon and heat the pan on the stove. Then I drop in a pat of butter and once it starts to sizzle, I crack an egg and drop the contents into the hot butter. Once the egg is cooked underneath, I use a spatula to flip the egg and cook the other side. I turn the gas off just before the egg is done so that the residual heat in the pan cooks the egg the rest of the way.I grab a plat and set it on the counter next to the stove. I pick up the pan by the handle and slide the egg onto the plate. I double check to make sure that I turned the gas off and let the pan cool before putting it in the sink.\n",

I made sure the light switch on the wall was in the OFF position. I set up the ladder under the light fixture and made sure the ladder was secure. I climbed the ladder far enough up to reach the light bulb. I unscrewed the light bulb by turning it to the left and removed it from the socket.

I searched for a spindle of colored thread that closely matched the color of my shirt, a needle, and some scissors. I lined the button up with the spot it fell off. Carefully, I pushed the needle through the fabric into one of the holes of the button, and threaded through the hole directly across from the hole I started from. I did this a few times, occasionally creating a criss-cross pattern with the other two holes in order to secure the button to the fabric. Once I felt that the button was secure enough, I tied a good knot to keep the thread from unraveling. My favorite shirt was now fixed, all with just a few minutes of simple sewing.\n",

We have been together for a long time, going on nine years, and have a toddler, so it is rare to be able to get away to have a date night. Both our families live pretty far away, so to go out without our child, we have to call a babysitter. Maria comes over to watch Alex, and we were able to go out to dinner. We went to a French restaurant, where I had a steak cooked medium rare, and he had a pasta with a creamy sauce and chicken. We split a creme brulee for dessert, paid the bill, left a tip for the waiter, and left. After dinner, we went to see the new Wonder Woman movie, it was action-packed and very exciting to watch.

We wanted to go here because of the theme park Universal Studios Hollywood, and how much we love the park. Planning this vacation took weeks. My parents booked a hotel room about a month in advance so that we wouldn't be struggling over finding a place to stay. Then, the week before leaving our home, we packed all of the clothes and toiletries that we would need for the time we would be gone. We also left our dog with a dog sitter, who would take care of them while we were gone. After all of the planning, packing, and booking, we were finally free to be on our way.

One day we went out to breakfast and then spent the entire day at the beach. We rented an umbrella so we could have some shade since it was an extremely hot and sunny day. We also rented a small locker box so we could keep our valuables safe. We made sure to apply plenty of sunscreen so we would not get sunburned and we also brought plenty of water with us so we would not get dehydrated.

We chose a small square paper to use for our invitation.  We folded this paper so that it looked like a card. We picked out a standard envelope to match the length and width of the card.  Next, we found some scrap booking materials to design our card. We purchased the items and left the store.  We made little pumpkins from the material, cut them out, and pasted them on the card.  In glitter and marker, we wrote, \"Happy Halloween\" on the front.  On the inside of the card, we used a marker to write a message.

When something like this happens , it can seem like a big deal , but is only a small inconvenience . I do n't even know how to repair a flat bicycle tire , but I know how I could do it myself . First , I would read about how to fix it and maybe look at a video from the internet . After I have learned how to repair it , I would go to the store to get some supplies . I would need the tools to fix it and a new tire or things to use for the repair . After arriving home , I would review the things I learned about how to repair the tire and I would follow the directions . Once it was repaired , I would test out the bicycle to make sure it was repaired and then I would clean up . \n",

Last week, Jim and Harry went to the park for lunch and while they were there, their moms asked for a picture.  So, Jim and Harry stood together at the swing set and let the picture be taken.  Jim wanted to try to take a picture with the camera on the phone.  His mom handed him the phone, and he pushed the button that had a  camera on it.  It opened the camera in the phone, and he pointed it at his friend and snapped the picture.  It came out a little blurry , so he had to do it again.  It was very easy to do, he held it up one more time and snapped the picture.  This time he held it steady, and the camera focused and was a nice shot of his friend Harry.\n",

I grab my car keys and I go to the car and visually check the tires to make sure they are not low or flat. I open the door and get in the car then I lock the door. I then check the mirrors to make sure that I see properly out of them.  I put my seatbelt on and then I put the car key into the ignition and crank up the car. I place the car in reverse and look around to make sure there are no other cars or pedestrians in my path. I slightly press the gas pedal and back up, then I place my foot on the brakes and change gears to drive, then I put my foot on the gas pedal and drive forward and  drive and follow the speed limit and road signs until I reach a stop sign, traffic light or signal. I pay attention to the traffic around me and stay in my traffic lane until I need to change lanes and make turns.  I make sure that I use my left and right blinkers to let the traffic around me know that I am changing lanes or that I will make a turn.  I look into my rear view and side mirrors often to check traffic around me. When I am ready to get to my destination, I turn my blinkers on, I slow the car down and make sure there are no pedestrians in my path, then I carefully drive to where I want to get to a parking spot, and put my foot on the brakes, then I place the car in park, and then I turn off the ignition and take the keys out of the ignition.

Anyway , the last time I had to do this was when I 'd apparently ran over some random , sharp piece of metal that got stuck in my front tire . I had to get some sealant and a little oil for my tire pump . I flipped by bike upside down and used a wrench to take the whole tire off . I have an older bike , so it 's easier to do it this way . I deflated the tire and then I took the outer tire off . I removed the metal bit from the tire and the bladder . I sealed the bladder and had to wait for it to cure . The outer tire got a little bit of repair mix too . After the various mixes dried , I inflated the bladder a bit and put both the bladder and the tire back on the wheel . This took a while , since I had to make sure that it was well within the wheel well , so that the tire would stay on . The last thing I really had to do was fully inflate the bladder and put the tire back on the bike . It took a little while to do , but it was better than buying an all new tire . \n",

I notice I am low on eggs and bread flour, so add them to the list. Next, I take a look at the flyer of sales for the week at the grocery store, circling items on sale that I might be interested in. After I finish, I flip through the flyer again, adding the circled items to my shopping list that I decide I really do want to get. For example, there's no need to get both ice cream and cookies, even if they're both on sale, so I only add ice cream to my list.

WE love water, and anything beside water. While planning for trip, we were considering distance from our house, and stay in motel. These 2 things were important, because it was biggest expense in out trip. Another important thing which we were most also, what things we can do at the place. We wanted to get maximum out of our trip. We searched for deals for these specific places. We found good deals for Disneyland, Florida. It has beach, it has amusement park and it has good food and motels, so we decided to go there. Then we started to look for motels which is close to the location with average facilities, specially free breakfast deal. We wanted to make sure that we choose the days which has low rates.

My wife will get a pot of water boiling for rice, and a pan for me for the chicken.  Our children will set the table, with a place mat, a plate, utensils, napkins and glasses and then go watch TV.  Once the pan is hot I put the chicken in to get them cooking, and I work on chopping up the vegetables.  My wife watches the water in the pot while making a salad, and once it is boiling she pours the rice in.  When the chicken is ready I flip it over, its nice and browned and the house smells great.  My wife has the vegetables in another pan as is cooking them with spices.  Everything smells so good, and I can't wait to eat.

When I wake up feeling this, my go-to meal is usually a plate of toast with jam, and a cup of either milk or orange juice depending on what was in the fridge. Obviously, I would first make sure that we had bread at all, and then I'd check for mold. If the bread was spoiled, I'd toss it in the trash and go to a nearby convenience store to buy a new loaf. It not, then I'd take two or four slices of bread depending on how hungry I was, and I'd put them in the toaster.

The main options for getting around are walking, taking the subway, bus, or taxi. We usually took the subway around, but decided to take a taxi from my hotel to see the Lion King on Broadway. I went out of the hotel and hailed a taxi by holding my hand up like you might see in the movies. A yellow taxi pulled up to stop, and I got inside. I told the driver where I needed to go, he started the meter, and off he went. The driver didn't talk much, and drove a little quickly for my liking, but I got there much sooner than the other transportation options would have taken.

I also picked up a couple of bags of potting soil.  When I got home, I set the plants in the shade and set about to prepare the soil where I would plant the flowers.  I used a shovel and plowed up the dirt a bit, then dug a small hole for each plant.  I set a flower plant in each hole, added a little of the potting soil, a little water, then tamped down the soil around the plant a little so that the roots of the plant would benefit from being covered with the moist soil.  It will take a few days for the plants to recover from the transplant into their new home, but if I continue to water them and keep animals away from them, they should do just fine.\n",

We are both picky about what we wanted to eat so we each prepared our own foods. I went to a gas station that also makes custom sandwiches and ordered a sandwich that I knew wouldn't get soggy and would be OK to sit in a cooler for awhile; I got turkey and cheese with tomato, lettuce and onion, I grabbed a few mayonnaise packets to take along and put on when I was ready to eat it. I picked up a large bottle of water since we were planning on kayaking and I wanted to stay hydrated and I also bought a can of Coke to drink with lunch. I took the sandwich and drinks home and put them in a cooler with an ice pack. I remembered I had some fruit salad in the fridge so I portioned some out into a plastic container and added that to the cooler as well. As I was leaving I remembered to grab a roll of paper towels and some plastic forks.\n",

I first rinsed my hair until it was very wet. I poured shampoo into my palms. I closed my eyes, so I would not get shampoo in them. I put the shampoo from my hands into my hair, making sure to get it very sudsy. I then rinsed it out. Once it was rinsed, I did the same thing again. Put shampoo on my hands, then my hair, then lather it until there was a lot of suds. I rinsed my hair well, and my eyes too, just in case there was soap in them. When all the shampoo was cleaned out, I got the bottle of conditioner. I squeezed the conditioner into my hands and put it on all of my hair. Making sure to reach the very ends. Once I had it in I rinsed it out, until there was no more conditioner in my hair. My hair looked very shiny.\n",

After we decided on the pattern we left to go to the wallpaper store.  When we got there, there were so many patterns to pick from.  A salesperson came over to help us make our selection.  We found what we wanted, bought the necessary supplies to hang the paper and went home to begin papering the room.  We started by measuring the walls, then we setup all the materials we needed to get started.  We unrolled the paper, put the paste on the backside of the paper and began to put it on the walls.

My mom gets the little bottle of pink medicine out of the cupboard and twists the top off until it opens. She gets a little silver spoon out of the drawer and then pours the pink medicine into the spoon until it is full. Then she carried the spoon, walking very slowly and carefully, over to my brother, who is sitting in his high chair, and says \"Open wide.\" My brother looks at the spoon and shakes his head and refuses to open his mouth. My mom tickles his tummy until he laughs and his mouth opens wide, then she pops the spoon into my brother's mouth, tilting it to the side so that all the medicine spills off the spoon onto his tongue.

We felt that going to the sauna would be the perfect way to relax and unwind. Fortunately, we live in a luxury apartment with a private sauna and pool. As residents of this apartment, we get free access to the sauna any time we want! It's a great deal and it's one of the best perks of living at my apartment. So, after getting lunch on Sunday, we changed into our swimsuits and each grabbed our towels and flip-flops. We then headed to the sauna at our apartment building, and enjoyed the feeling of being in the sauna. As soon as we'd been in the sauna for twenty minutes, both of us felt the stresses of the week just melting away, which was a great feeling.\n",

The box was a perfect cube, so I sat it down on the paper and cut the edges to make sure that each side was completely covered.  The wrapping paper is so beautiful, it has glitter and sparkles.  Once the paper is cut I taped each side to the bottom of the box.  My daughter came into the room at this point and asked to help me.  She gets so excited to be my little helper.  We turned the box on it's top and folded the paper on one side into a triangle.  She was watching so carefully so I let her do the other side on her own.  Once both sides were taped down we turned the box over and I let her pick out which bow she wanted to put on the top.  She picked a gold bow.

Reaching inside I pulled out the tools I'd need, needle, thread, scissors, and a new button which thankfully matched the other ones. I found a quiet corner to sit down in and settled on the ground with the shirt spread open in my lap. I studied the button for a moment, noticing that it had four tiny holes in the middle of its face. I pulled the thread through the eye of the needle, getting it through the first time, then knotted the other end. I carefully placed my needle on the inside of the shirt where the old button used to be and pushed it through the fabric, making sure the needle went through one of the button's little holes too. Pulling the thread tight I pushed the needle back through a different hole on the button and through the fabric. Over and over I moved the needle in and out of the button holes, making a little x with my thread until the x felt nice and thick.  I pulled the needle through one last time so that it was on the inside of the shirt, took it off of the thread and knotted the thread end right next to the fabric. I gave the button a gentle tug to make sure it was secure and smiled. I was going to get to wear this shirt after all.\n",

I placed the full bag on the ground and tied the top edges of the garbage bag together so that none of the garbage could come out.

I use comet to clean my shower because it reminds me of the movie Mommy Dearest. I like to fling the comet around like Joan Crawford while yelling the name Christina over and over. This entertains me. First I take all of my soaps and shampoos out of the shower so nothing is in my way. Then I fling the comet around. Then I take a wet sponge and scrub the tile while mumbling about things are never clean enough and wire hangers and such. Once everything is scrubbed I turn on the shower and rinse away the comet and dirty. Then I repeat the process over again because that's what Joan Crawford would do. Though I doubt she actually did that. It was probably her maids.\n",

First I arrange the cocoa, the sugar, measuring spoons, and a nice cup on the counter, so everything is ready to go. Next I get out fresh milk, and pour a cup of it into a large enough pot that there's room for the milk to expand as it gets hot. Then I put the pot on the stove and turn it on. As the milk starts to heat, it expands, and rises in the pot. I keep my eye on it, and keep stirring gently, so that the  milk won't cook onto the pan. When I see bubbles forming around the edge of the milk I know it is hot enough, and turn off the stove. I measure out my cocoa and sugar, and stir them in. Then I pour the chocolate milk into the cup. I do that very carefully, because it's still very hot. For an extra treat, I float a big marshmallow on top of the milk, and watch it melt.\n",

When Tuesday morning arrived, I woke up, took a shower and headed out the door to the doctors office.  I arrived at the office at 08:45 am  and signed in.  Being a few minutes early would give me time to take care of any business I needed too before I saw the doctor.  I gave the receptionist my insurance card so she could copy it and then I verified my address with her.  I then had a seat in the waiting area before the nurse called me to the back.  The nurse took my vitals before placing me in a room to await my turn with the doctor.  The doctor came in just after 9:00 am and we talked for few minutes.  He then left and sent in his nurse to give me my allergy shot.  After my shot, I left the room and made my way to the payment area where I paid my $30.00 copay.

Then I bring the basket to a big box called the washer. My mother comes in and puts the laundry into the washer. I watch as it turns and jiggles. Sometimes it makes the floor feel like there is an earthquake! The washer makes swoosh sounds and I watch as the clothes spin around and around. Click! The washer is done washing my clothes. My mother comes back in and smiles at me, then she puts the wet clothes into another big box, called the dryer. Once the clothes are in the dryer she pushes a button and the dryer starts. This box is very loud! It sounds like a herd of dinosaurs are walking across my yard. When the dryer stops, the clothes are dry.

I figured the cause of this problem was either that the clock was broken, incorrectly, set, or out of batteries. Upon inspection, I could tell that the clock wasn't running so I'd try changing out the batteries. I removed the cover panel, took out the old batteries, and replaced them with fresh batteries of the same size. Then I put the battery cover back on and re-adjusted the time. I had to look at another clock in my house to see what the time was. Once the clock was set, I checked back on it in 10 minutes to see that the time was correctly moving forward.

After they have eaten they will need to go to the bathroom like grownups. However, because they cannot stand or sit by themselves, their mothers and fathers let them wear large plastic pants that the babies use to pee or poop in. After the baby has used their pants to go to the bathroom someone must change the plastic pants and put clean ones on the baby. The baby will cry if his or her panties are not changed. The parent or helper will gently lay the baby on their back, usually on a padded table. Then the helper will take the plastic pants off the baby. The baby will need to be cleaned. Usually someone will use a towel that has been moistened to wipe the baby's rear end and legs and anywhere else that is soiled. Then the parent or helper will gently lift the baby's bottom and slide another pair of clean plastic pants under the baby's bottom. After the pants are centered, the helper will seal the sides of the pants with tape. Now the baby is clean!\n",

I want to run the vacuum to remove dust, dirt and if there are any particles on the floor. Now we have to get a bucket and fill it with hot water and mix in floor detergent. You have to wet the mop. It's best to start in the corner of a room and move out so you back yourself out and are able to get out of the room with boxing yourself in and then have to walk across the wet floor. Start scrubbing your floor with the mop, always checking to be sure the mop is not getting too dirty. When you start to notice the water on the floor getting dirty, dip the mop in the bucket to rinse it and wring it out and repeat. As they say rinse and repeat until your floor is completely clean. It shouldn't take more than about 30 minutes to completely dry and then you have to move all the furniture and other things that were sitting on the floor back into the room.\n",

I went to the store the next day and bought what I needed. Once I was home, I unpacked my bags and got to work. First, I needed to get on the right clothing. I changed into something I wouldn't mind getting paint on. After that, I moved things away from the wall. Then I poured some white paint into the paint pan and dipped my brush into it. I brought my brush to the wall. I painted the wall from top to bottom, but some parts were hard to reach. In the end, I ended up having to get a ladder just so I could paint everything! Painting the wall was hard work. Once the wall was entirely painted, I left the wall to dry. Painting was difficult, but it was worth it.\n",

We read the menus to see what we would like to order. The milkshakes looked good, but I didn't want to get too much food and feel sick afterward. I decided to get a burger, fries, and a soda. My partner got the same, but with seasoned fries instead of regular fries. We gave our orders to the woman behind the counter, paid, and waited until our food was ready. When our food came out, we took it to a table and sat down. We both liked our food, although we did like the burgers better than the fries. When we were done, we waited to see what we should do with our garbage because we didn't see trash cans. We noticed that the people who work at the restaurant take away trash after customers are done eating, so we left our trays on the table. Afterwards, we walked to the subway station and took a train home.\n",

I felt like panicking a little bit, since I didn't have any time to go out to the store and get her a birthday gift. I decided the perfect solution was to shop for a gift online. With online shopping, I could get my friend a gift much faster. I went to my computer, then got onto the Internet. I searched for my favorite online marketplace, Amazon. I entered \"birthday gift ideas\" into the search bar on Amazon and browsed the many options that Amazon has for birthday gifts. There were plenty of gift ideas, like candy baskets and birthday cakes and gift cards. I decided to send my friend an electronic gift card, since that would reach her the fastest and I could get it to her by her birthday. I selected a $25 gift card to Starbucks, then entered my credit card information to pay for the gift. The gift was emailed directly to my friend, who loved it!\n",

This included lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, broccoli, and carrot. I rinsed off each vegetable and removed my cutting board from he cabinet. I placed each vegetable on the cutting board and began to cut them with a large knife, making sure to remove peels and stems that were inedible. I threw these parts away in the garbage. I made sure to cut the vegetables into small, bite-sized pieces and slices, especially the larger vegetables like broccoli and lettuce. I also cut the vegetables slowly to avoid injuring myself with the knife. As I finished cutting each vegetable, I put it into a large bowl.

She made my brother and me matching outfits, too. My dress looks just like Grandma's, and my brother wears a hat with a blue band and cowboy boots exactly like Grandpa's. When the music begins, a caller tells the dancers to bow to their partners, and the dance begins. He calls out instructions for the dancers and they perform them. It was hard at first to keep up, but my brother and I have become very good at square dancing. Sometimes, when we get tired, we will drink punch at one of the tables and watch our grandparents dance. Grandma's colorful skirt swirls when she spins, and Grandpa's shiny boots gleam under the lights on the dance floor. I like to dance with Grandpa. When I was younger, I would stand on his boots and he would twirl me around the dance floor! After all that dancing we will go out for ice cream and talk about the fun we all had.\n",

There are times of the year that getting gift wrapping paper is a challenge because it is close to themed holidays like Christmas or Valentine Day. I keep a roll or two for those occasions. At home, I got a table cleaned out of other stuff. Brought the gift, paper, tape, and scissors. This looks like a pretty easy one since it was just a plain square box. I measure the gift box against the paper, but apparently I cut it too small, so I didn't cover it all. I had to try again and I got it right this time. I folded the paper and tapped it all up. Then I found a ribbon and a card to stick on it. I set down the gift to the side until I had to take it with me.\n",

Put the bagels in so that when the bagel button is pressed, the cut side is facing the heated elements of the toaster. Don't want to toast both sides of the bagel. No for the lox, the deep the color red, the better it is. Be careful and read the package. If it doesn't say salmon then is this other cheaper and tasteless fish that looks like salmon. The salmon is already cut razor thin so only have to open up the package to remove the fish slices. The cream cheese is the full flavored cream cheese. Not the low calorie. Having a little pre-softened up on the counter is preferable. Having the cream cheese too hard makes it difficult to spread the cream cheese. Get Walla Walla sweet onion and slice very thinly. Once the bagel halves are toasted, spread the cream cheese, add slice of lox and then some onion slices and there is you power breakfast at 4am in the morning that will last 4 hours while snow skiing in the great white north.\n",

I had to find some wrapping paper, so I went to the store and purchased some that said \"Happy Birthday\" on it.  I went back home and rolled out a large strip of wrapping paper.  I then cut the strip off, before placing the book on the inner, white section of the paper.  I grabbed some scotch tape and prepared a small strip with one hand, while wrapping two ends of the paper up over the book with the other.  While holding the paper down, I then taped it together so that the paper wrapped the book on one side.  Finally, I folded in the other two sides over the book and taped them down to totally wrap it.

We started going through Connecticut and up the beach highway through Rhode Island, and ended up spending the fourth of July in Boston at a hotel overlooking the bay. Mark had some relatives he had not seen or spoken to in a long time that connected with me on Facebook when they saw he was tagged in a photo. He never logs in. It turned out they lived close by and wondered if we would drop by for a visit. We said we would love to. The next day we headed over to visit Mark's aunt Jan and Uncle Nick. They had a cute little home with a nice wooded backyard, and open windows to let the breeze in. We sat and talked for several hours about our families, and how life had been over the many years Mark had not seen or spoken to them. They had prepared a delicious lunch for us, and after that we headed on the road again going to Maine. We are sure to keep in touch more often now.\n",

I told them about the party a couple weeks before Halloween, so that they would know about it ahead of time and would not make other plans.  Next I started to get decorations for the house.  I got some spooky looking fake spiderwebs to hang from the ceiling, and some pumpkins to carve into jack o' lanterns.  I used a knife to cut off the top of the pumpkins, and scooped out the pumpkin flesh into a bag.  Then I carved shapes into the pumpkins to make faces.  I went to the grocery store and got food and beverages for the party so that people would have something to snack on.  I found my pirate costume in my closet.  The night of the party, I put candles in the jack o' lanterns, and put on my costume before the guests arrived.  I also played a playlist of Halloween songs.

I went to our medicine cabinet in the bathroom and got the Children's Liquid Tylenol down from the high shelf where I keep it out of her reach.  It tastes good, like cherry syrup, so I don't want her to accidentally find it and take too much of it. I checked on the label to see what the correct dosage was, and then got a measuring spoon from the kitchen to measure just the right amount. I put the medicine into the spoon and held it out to her, telling her it was a nice treat that would make her feel better.  My daughter opened her mouth and let me put the spoon full of medicine in, and then swallowed.

I could not find anything that I wanted to watch on the channels.  I decided to look at the movies that were for rent through my cable provider.  Some of the movies that were for rent cost way too much money.  Some of the movies you could only buy and they weren't even available to rent.  It was hard for me to decide between the movies that were available, so I watched free previews for a couple of the movies.  I decided to rent a comedy with an actor that I like.  I pushed the button that said \"rent\" and I confirmed that I wanted to rent it.  A message on the screen said I had access to the movie for the next 24 hours.  I watched the movie right then, and it was pretty good.\n",

Because of this, I wanted to make breakfast for them so that they could eat when they got out of bed. I decided that I would cook Pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs. I got out everything I needed, and heated up the griddle that I would use to cook everything. I started with the pancakes. I mixed the batter according to the box that it came from, and made enough for the family on the griddle. Next was the bacon. I laid down an entire package's worth of bacon on the griddle and cooked it until most of the fat was cooked off. Lastly, the eggs. I scrambled the eggs myself with a fork, and made some for everyone but myself, since I don't like eggs. When my family woke up, they immediately came to the kitchen and saw that I made them all breakfast. They all enjoyed it, which made me very happy.\n",

It was windy, but nothing stopped us, the waves were not so choppy. We stayed there for 3 days, and did not waste a minute. In the morning when it was cool, we hopped in Jacuzzi and warm swimming pool. It was very clean and big. They gave us complimentary lunch for our family. The service was good, but expensive.

He lived a wonderful life and when he died he was surrounded by all of his children and grand children.  According to his family he seemed ready to pass away and in his words he was \"on to his next adventure.\"  His funeral was truly a celebration of a beautiful life well lived.  The atmosphere was extremely celebratory.  Following the church service there was a very large part at a neighboring Greek restaurant.  Many people gave toasts to pay tribute to his passing, and others told funny and engaging stories about his youth and his family.  The whole event really reminded me of the importance of family and the amazing roles our elders play in our lives.\n",

Of course, some of them know when it's time to be fed and get excited right away by swimming to the top, looking for floating food. I take the fish food out of the drawer where I keep it and take the top off, it's important to keep the fish food closed so it stays fresh. I know that more than one pinch will be too much and make the water cloudy so I carefully sprinkle just the right amount in the water, and then I stand back so the shy fish can come out and find food too.

We arrive at the train station at 5:30 am , snacks and blankets in tow in our bags . We purchased our tickets the other day , so we did n't have to worry about going to a booth to buy any . We went up to the attendant who was taking the train tickets to allow people on board , and we handed him ours . We hopped onto the train and took our seats towards the back of the train so that we could discuss a lot of what we were going to say and do in the meetings for our trip without being distracted much . As we discussed our plans and strategies , we 'd occasionally look out the window and see lush trees and valleys , animals , plains , and all manner of environments as we traveled from state to state . We had to switch trains a few times at different stations , but the process was pretty smooth and it is always nice to hear that whistle and the ALL ABOARD ! When we arrived at our destination , we got off of the train , exited the train station , and made our way to 52nd Street in our rental car . \n",

Walter is pretty lazy but about 5 times a week he likes to get outside for a while and walk around to take in some interesting smells. On these days, I will usually wait until around 9am before I tell Walter he is going to get a walk. Once he hears that word he gets incredibly excited and jumps around, almost knocking pictures off of my walls. I have a special harness that allows me to control Walter when he gets excited, but does not choke or hurt him. I put his harness on him while he wiggles excitedly and attach the leash before we go outside. I walk around a loop in my neighborhood for around 30 minutes before Walter gets tired and wants to go home. After we get back, I give Walter a treat if he was good and prepare his breakfast for him.\n",

It has a brake pedal on the passenger side of the car where the instructor rides, in case he needs to stop you from hitting something. I got inside and went down the ten point pre-driving inspection list I had memorized, with things like checking to make sure the car seat and mirrors are properly adjusted for my size. Then with my instructors permission, I turned the key and started the car.  It was parked at the curb so I checked traffic, then pulled out into the flow of traffic on my left.  The instructor told me where to turn, and which way to go. I concentrated on remembering to be safe, to watch the traffic around me, and to use my turn signals and mirrors wisely. At the end of the lesson, we pulled up in front of the drivers school building and the instructor helped me with directions to parallel park the car back where it had been when we left.

My grandma would make all kinds of sweets and let me watch all kinds of movies and such that I would also want to go up more than that. She used to make the best cookies and cakes a kid could ever hope for. She also had the best dollhouses and some of the oldest toys I've ever seen. Stuff you probably didn't even know existed.

After I changed my clothes, I put on his leash, got some plastic bags to collect any of his poop, and grabbed a bottle of water. It was a very hot day, so I wanted to make sure we both had water to drink. As we started walking down the street, a neighbor's dog ran out at us, startling my dog and me. I was nervous because the dog was very aggressive and loud. I knew my dog would protect me but I was worried there would be a confrontation. As it turned out, once they barked at each other, they were friendly. The dog's owner came out of his house and apologized. As a result, I got to meet one of my neighbors whom I'd never met before and he got along just fine. We decided we should let our dogs play together because they got along so well.\n",

I asked him to sit, and he sat on the ground. I attached the leash to his collar and opened the door. We walked outside and I was sure to lock the door behind me. We walked down the street and the dog sniffed some plants, some grass and a street sign. He was interested in some bushes, so I let him smell them for a few minutes. After that, we got to the park where he could use the restroom. I was sure to bring extra bags in case this happened. I threw the bag away in the garbage, and we started our walk home. He sniffed the same bushes we passed earlier once again. Once we got home, I opened the door, took off his leash, and gave him a treat for being a good boy. It was a very good walk.\n",

I didn't want to pay the extra fees, so I looked up the carry on size and went out and bought a new suitcase that was small enough to carry on. It was a hard shell suitcase that could expand. It was black with orange polka dots, which is not usually my style, but it was on sale and fit the dimensions I needed. I laid the suitcase on my bed and began to sort through the clothes I needed: some underwear, socks, shirts, pants, pajamas, a dress, and some dress shoes. I folded all the clothes neatly and began arranging them inside my suitcase. I put my shoes in a separate section, along with my toiletry case. The expansion on the suitcase made it so it zippered and closed easily, and I was all packed and ready to go.\n",

I looked through the menu to see what I was hungry for and ordered the #15 club tuna with a bag of chips and a fountain drink. Since I had some more things to do before heading home I decided to eat in the restaurant. I paid for my food and waited for my sandwich to be made. I put ice in my cup, filled it with Coke, put on a lid and put a straw in. When my sandwich was done being made I thanked the employee and sat down to eat it, it had the perfect amount of toppings and I did not need to remove or add anything extra.

Once my friends arrived we gathered in the kitchen to make the cake . The first thing we did was set the stove to the temperature indicated on the box . While the stove warmed up I asked my friend Nikki to be in charge of getting things from the fridge while my friend Stephanie went to the cabinets to get whatever I called out that was needed there . Once we had the bowls , measuring cups , and liquid ingredients from the fridge we were ready to start mixing . Three people making a cake is a bit difficult to do , but we had fun talking while we were doing it and I ended up doing most of it while my friends chatted with me . I put the mix in the bowl and added the fresh ingredients . We took turns mixing that up and then poured the mix into a cake pan that Nikki greased with some butter . I then put the cake into the stove while wearing oven mitts and set the stove 's timer to the suggested baking time on the box . While it baked we could n't help spooning out some icing for ourselves .\n",

I put water in a large pot, added some salt, and put the stove on high setting. Then I took the ground beef and put it in a pan. I turned the stove on medium and started breaking the large piece of meat up with my wooden spoon. I stirred the meat until it was completely brown. Then I took a jar of marinara sauce and added it to the meat. I stirred in the sauce thoroughly and put the heat on low. The water was boiling, so I took the pasta out of the box and put it in the water. I stirred while the spaghetti cooked until it was soft. Then I poured the noodles in the sauce and mixed them all together. My family really liked it.\n",

My Mom has already bought the paint that I need from the paint shop. Painting is a messy job so we have to be very careful when we are preparing. I put on my oldest clothes and we get an old bed sheet and spread it out on the floor. I find a paint roller and the tray and put it down on the sheet. I pour some of the green paint into the roller tray. Rolling with paint is easier than using a paint brush. It is much faster. I roll the roller in the paint and then start to roll it onto the wall. I roll until the paint runs out and then I roll it in the paint again. This is fun! The blue paint starts to disappear. The green looks really nice. We need to let this coat dry and tomorrow we will do this all again. I will have a green wall in my bedroom before I go to sleep tomorrow night. I love painting.\n",

I remember first arriving at the train station and walking down the steps to the underground train station. After walking downstairs, I sat on the bench in the dirty, gross platform area. I waited for about five minutes until the train arrived and I let people get off. Following that, I got on the train and sat down. The seats were hard, but the train was air conditioned and we started. We stopped at every station and after a few stations, we arrived at mine and I got off.

Since my wife and I lived in New York, we knew that driving there would be difficult, so we decided to fly.  Making a reservation is always difficult since you get severely penalized for changing or canceling your plans, so we were careful to make sure our work and families would be okay with our plans before booking.  We started tracking our flight on a couple of sites to see what kind of prices we could get.  One morning, a price alert came through indicating that the price dropped and that we could save a lot of money if we acted quickly.  We logged onto the Web site and confirmed our purchase before those unpredictable machines could change their minds and raise the prices again.  Florida here we come!\n",

I got ready.  I dressed in black, since a funeral is a sad event.  I left my house thirty minutes before the funeral began so that I could get there on time.  Once I got there, I got out of my car and I went inside of the church where the funeral was going to be.  There were rows and rows of pews, where people were sitting.  I sat in the front pew since I was a close family relative to my grandma.  I sat down next to my mom, my dad, and my sister.  Once I sat down my family and I waited five more minutes until the funeral began.  At the front of the room, was my grandma.  She was in an open coffin.  In front of her, behind a podium was the pastor.  The pastor was reading a scripture from the bible.  Afterwards he said nice things about my grandma and how she lived her life.  After the pastor was done, a lot of my family members went up to the podium and talked about my grandma and how much they were going to miss her.  After we were done, we got in our cars to drive to the grave yard where she would be buried.  We drove in a long line, in front of us was grandma in her coffin in the back of a hearse.  There was a police car guiding us to the grave yard.  Once we got there, we walked out to where my grandma would be buried and we watched the coffin go into a hole in the ground.  Once she was buried I looked at her head stone.  Her head stone said beloved mother, grandmother, and friend.  We laid flowers on her grave.

I was not sure if I wanted a Charge 1 or 2. I also checked online on other websites such as Ebay, Craigslist, backpage, wish, and Jet. Overall, I decided to go with Amazon because I have some gift cards for that website that I have not been able to use for a long time. Well, I have more than some gift cards per se. I have about $400 that I am trying to get rid of. I like the Fitbit Charge 2 best of all because it has a clock feature and is not too expensive.

They dropped me off at the driving school on Saturday afternoon, and I went inside to check in. The instructor met me in the lobby and took me to the practice car. It had \"Student Driver\" painted on the sides so other drivers would know I was learning. Since I already knew many of the basic rules of driving, the instructor decided to move on with the lessons. I sat in the driver's seat, put on my seatbelt and turned the key to start the engine. The instructor told me to place my foot on the brake and put the car in reverse. I checked my mirrors for any nearby cars, and I slowly backed out of my parking space. I braked again, and I placed the car in drive. The instructor taught me how to use turn signals and how to park.

If any cups or glasses up there got turned over and filled with water, I empty them and dry them. If any of the bottoms of the glasses are wet, I wipe them dry as well. Then I put everything from that rack in its place in a cupboard or drawer. Next, I do the biggest plates, stacking them in the cupboard. Smaller plates get stacked on top of them, and then the smallest plates of all. Bowls are stacked in the same cupboard, next to the plates. Last, I pull out the silverware basket, and put it on the counter above the silverware drawer. Then, I pull out the silverware and serving-ware and put each piece in its spot. I check each one as I go, because dishwashers sometimes make mistakes.\n",

I picked up the phone and dialed the number to the restaurant.  There was a pleasant hostess answering.  I told her about my problem and asked if I could get a reservation.  She asked me information like what time and how many of us there would be.  I told her any time would be fine and it was just my wife and me.  The hostess booked me down for a reservation at seven.

The event has largely become popular for how often people meet new romantic partners at the dance. Last year, I met the love of my life at the dance. I arrived at town hall around dusk along with a few friends of mine. We were all very sharply dressed. We went inside and the music was already bumping. The ballroom floor was filled with people. I noticed a few women alone in the crowd, seemingly looking for partners. I danced with a few different people throughout the night, but at around midnight I saw her. She was alone on the edge of the dance floor, and she looked so beautiful. I went up to her, asked her to dance with me, and the rest is history.\n",

After checking that they printed correctly and folding them in half, I placed them in envelopes and sealed each once shut by licking the adhesive on the envelope. I then placed return address labels on the upper left corner and stamps on the upper right corner of each envelope. Next, I grabbed my address list for the guests. I hand wrote each name and address of the center of each envelope, making sure to write all information down correctly. This included the guest name, house number, street name, town, city, state, and zip code. I then took all of the envelopes, and placed them in my mailbox.

First, I went to the store to get some cleaning supplies, including a broom, some dish soap, and some window cleaner. The first thing I did was clean the bathroom, which involved scrubbing the toilets, changing the paper roll, and wiping the mirror. After that, I vacuumed the floor of my living room and kitchen, and mopped it clean. I also had to do a load of dishes, which was my least favorite part. Finally, I had to clean my bedroom, which was the most difficult part of the whole day. I used a broom to sweep all of the dust from under my bed, and used a wet paper towel to wipe off all of the dust on my desk and dresser.

It is important to only do this activity at the beach because that is the safest place to have a bonfire.  My friends and I planned to have a bonfire last night.  I was in charge of collecting enough wood for the fire, so I spent the day doing just that.  I combed the beach looking for pieces of driftwood and other materials that would be safe to burn.  I met my friends at the beach and we started assembling a \"pit\" for the fire.  The pit is a circle made with rocks, this keeps the fire contained.  We then added the wood to the fire and lit the wood to start the bonfire.  Once the fire was safely going we decided to make smores as a tasty treat.  Bonfires are a great way to spend time with friends.\n",

I wanted to paint the room a different color, so the next thing I did was move all of my furniture out of my room. I painted the walls light purple. I then decided that it was important to have curtains to cover my windows. I drove to a housewares store and picked out curtains to match the paint. When I got home I hung the curtains. I had some pictures that were frames that were in a closet, so I decided that these would be good decorations for the room. I hung the pictures of my family, friends, and I around the room. The next thing I decided to do was to move my furniture back into the room. I wanted to rearrange it in a different way, so I moved it back in piece by piece putting it exactly where I wanted. I also wanted to add a new chair to my room, so I searched a furniture website online and found the perfect chair to go with my new room.

On an electric stove it take more time for the heating element to heat up and cool down. On a gas stove you just adjust the flame with a dial and then the flame gets bigger or smaller. Some stoves have to be started with a match by turning on the gas and then letting the flame of the match ignite the gas.  But usually when turning the dial the flame turns right on. I put the food into a pan and put it on the rack above the flame. Some stoves have small racks for small pans and big racks for bigger pans. The dial that adjusts the flame usually makes a clicking sound about half a turn to help adjust how big you want the flame.\n",

After we agreed on the dates we next needed to decided where it was that we wanted to go, luckily we all agreed that we wanted to visit someplace hot with nice beaches so we could enjoy the sun, sand, and ocean. it wasn't easy to decided on but once we all agreed on the location all we needed to worry about next was airfare, transportation to the hotel and a place to stay. Next we contacted a travel agent, which is a person that books trips for people, after the travel agent booked our trip all that was left to do was to pay for the trip. While we waited for the day of our trip to arrive we made sure to pack all of the items we would need while on are trip so that we would be prepared and ready to go the day of our trip.

I got to the office and checked in with the receptionist, I wrote down my name and the time I was supposed to be there. After a few minutes they asked me to come back and I sat in the dentist chair. The dentist came out to talk to me and she was very nice. She looked at my teeth and asked me how I was brushing and flossing them and I said I was doing well. She said that my teeth looked well and then she was going to clean them. To clean them she took a little tool and scraped off some gunk that was on my teeth, then she brushed them and flossed them for me.

I parked outside JCPenney where I normally park and it is in the middle of the mall so it's easy to access anything. I wasn't sure what I was going to buy so I had to browse throughout several different stores. I stopped in the food court and had lunch at a restaurant that had really good sandwiches and fries. I did find myself a new pair of sneakers at Dick's Sporting Goods that were a great price and fit perfectly. I browsed through a few more stores and also bought myself a candle at Yankee Candle and some gourmet popcorn. I stopped at Starbucks on my way out and ordered a frappuccino.

When I iron my clothes, I take one piece of clothing at a time and put it on my ironing board. The ironing board is a special kind of table that I can iron clothing on safely. Then, I take my iron and being pressing the clothes. A clothes iron is very hot, and uses hot steam to soften the clothes so the hot metal can press the clothing flat. I iron my shirts and pants until they're nice and flat, so they look good and fit better in my closet. Ironing can be dangerous, because the iron is so hot. You have to be very careful so you don't get burned by hot steam or on the hot metal. Once I'm done, my clothes look great and they're ready to put away.\n",

Today, Henry came up to me while I was watering the house plants.  He was purring and meowing as he circled my legs.  I scooped him up and we walked into the kitchen.  I put him down by his food and water bowls.  I went into the pantry and grabbed a cup of dry cat food.  I added it to his food bowl.  Then I opened a can of wet cat food and cut it up and put it on top of the dry cat food.  Henry eagerly starts eating his food, still purring enthusiastically.

First, I boiled a bit more than two cups of water, which was slightly above what the package called for. I seasoned the water with some salt and sesame oil for flavor. I also added a handful of frozen mixed vegetables. I then cracked open three eggs into a bowl, and sliced four hot dogs into diagonal slices. Once the water was boiling I added both the block of dried ramen and the seasoning packets from the package. I also added the sliced hot dogs, as well as two slices of Swiss cheese to give the broth more flavoring and creaminess. I then let it boil for two minutes. Finally, I poured the three eggs from the bowl into the pot and let it boil for an additional minute and a half before taking it off the heat. That way the egg whites would firm up, but the yolk would remain runny.\n",

When I initially wake up in the morning I go into the kitchen and open the loaf of seven grain bread and pour a cup of coffee.   I then remove two slices of bread and put them into the toaster oven.  I toast the bread until the timer rings and then I usually end up toasting the bread again because I enjoy my toast toasted really well.  Once my toast is done I put it on to a plate and decide what topping I would like to have on my toast.  Usually I decide between butter and grape jelly.

We took off our clothing in the dressing area, then wrapped ourselves in towels to be polite, and put on some clogs.  Fortunately, the sauna was already hot, or we would have had to wait for it to warm up! When I got into the sauna, we sat down side by side on the warm wooden bench.  The dry heat was quite comfortable, and we chatted for about ten minutes. Then we went out into the cooling area, and poured cold water over ourselves: that cooled us down and made us ready for the next stage. We made sure to drink some water too. After we walked back into the sauna, and closed the door, the attendant ladled water over the hot stones, and the air filled with steam! This warmed us up again, but now it was wetter than the first time we went in. It felt like a hot summer day in there: we were really sweating, but that was what we liked about it! Again, we waited about ten minutes before going out to the cooling room: the cold water washed away our sweat.  We went back and forth between the hot and cool parts twice more before taking a cool shower to end the day. Then we put our clothes back on and left. My friends and I felt very clean and relaxed: we were all happy after our time in the sauna!\n",

Next I put some bathtub cleaner on the sponge of onto the shower walls and start scrubbing. Usually I move the sponge up and down then side to side to make sure I scrubbed every inch. I also clean the faucet and drain an shower head. Next its time to turn on the shower and let the water wash the shower walls so the bathtub cleaner will go down the drain.

And of course I'll need to eat, so I'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire.  It helps to bring a cooler to keep the food and drinks cold and fresh.  I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire.  Along with my camping gear I'll need to bring clothes, like hiking shoes, a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights.

The first thing I needed to do before I left was pack my suitcase. First, I looked at the packing list my travel agent had sent me. I went through my closet and pulled out everything that was on the list from the travel agent. I laid everything in a big pile on my bed and then brought out my suitcase. I began to put all of my clothes in my suitcase. I put the larger things in first, since I could use extra room to squeeze in smaller things such as socks. I packed three pairs of pants, five tops, two jackets, ten pairs of socks, ten pairs of underwear, and two pairs of shoes. I made sure to include my toiletries in the bag as well. Once I had looked over my packing list and made sure I had everything I needed, I zipped up my suitcase and went to sleep to be well rested for my trip.\n",

Every week, I wash everybody's clothes. I start with Alex, my toddler, and put all his clothes together into the washing machine. I pour in some detergent and start the washer on the warm setting. The clothes swish around and spin themselves clean. While that laundry is in the washing machine, I separate my and my husband's light and dark clothing. I put Alex's clothes into the dryer, and wash my husband's clothes, followed by mine. I fold all the clothes as they get dry, and put them away. Each type of item gets put away in its own drawer. I then wash all the sheets on the bed so it gets nice and clean. My favorite part of laundry day is getting into a bed with clean, warm sheets.\n",

I called my hairdresser and made an appointment to go and see her the following week to get a hair cut . It was difficult getting an appointment because she was very busy but I managed to get one . I drove to the hair salon where she works and parked the car . I walked inside and spoke to the lady on the reception desk to tell her who I was and who I was there to see , and she asked me to take a seat in the waiting area . There were lots of hair products on shelves around where I was sitting , and some hair style magazines on a table in front of the sofa I was sitting on . My stylist came through a door and greeted me and took me past people sitting on chairs in front of mirrors , all of them in various stages of having a hair cut . I sat down at my stylist 's usual chair and faced the mirror while she asked me what I wanted her to do . Sometimes when I go to see her I will have a picture of a style that I like that I have found on the internet or in a magazine but this time I just wanted her to keep it the same style but make it shorter . First of all she took me to an area with basins for washing hair and I had to sit with my back to it , with my head tilted back so my hair was in the basin . My stylist rolled up a towel and put it under the back of my neck to make the position more comfortable and washed my hair for me . After she was done she took me back to the chair and started to cut my hair , she pinned up sections of hair that she was n't working on and gradually let them down to cut them , eventually she had done all of it . She plugged in the hairdryer and sprayed some lotion onto my hair to make it easier to blow dry and proceeded to dry my hair until it was all dry and styled and shorter . When she was finished she held up a mirror for me so I could see the back of my hair . I was happy with it so I said goodbye and walked back to the lady on the reception desk to pay her for the hair cut . \n",

I continued to drive, as I stayed in my lane and watched the speed limits posted. I enjoyed the ride and even though my friend wanted to talk, I focused on driving the entire time rather than having a conversation. When there was traffic, I drove a little slower, as I did around the turns. I used my break softly to ensure that the drive was safe and enjoyable for everyone. Upon arriving at my destination, I parked between the lines even though there were not many spots left and I pulled the keys out of the ignition and parked the car. Then I got out of the car and used the remote to lock the car. I had a good time and was safe.\n",

It always takes a long time for the hot water to get to the shower. So I turned on the shower and bathroom sink faucet to help get the hot water to the bathroom quicker. I put my towel on the shower rod while I was waiting for it to get hot. Once in the show I noticed I needed to buy some more soap and shampoo. The water felt good. I guess I was in the shower a long time because the water started to get cool. I thought I better wash all the soap off quick. I did just in time.

The first thing we did was look at our schedules and go online to see what was going on in Florida on the days we would be able to go. After we figured out when we would be leaving and returning it was time to find a flight. We had to look at different airlines and compare prices and flight times from our location to Florida and also for the return trip to get back home. A flight that was cheap and did not have any layovers we would have to wait through was our top choice. We decided on Delta so we used their website to register and paid with a credit card to order four tickets and print them. We looked at all of the different rules and regulations about what is allowed on the airplane and the procedures when arriving at the airport.\n",

We went to the hardware store and picked out a light-blue paint for the walls and an off-white color for the ceiling. Then we went to pick out the new carpet. We also picked out new light fixtures and light-switches. When we got home, we took all of the furniture out of the room. Then we got to work ripping up all of the old carpeting. Once that was up, we put painter's tape down to protect the floor and fixtures, and to keep the corners of the room clean. After that, we put paint into a paint tray and painted the ceiling with a roller. We touched up the edges with paintbrushes and then got started on the walls. Once we completed the paint job, we laid down the new carpet. We finished up by putting in the new fixtures and light switches. Our bedroom looks much nicer now.\n",

We paid the cashier at the store and went home. I went into the bathroom with my new shampoo and poured a small amount into my hand.  I walked to the sink. I turned the water onto cold and a little hot.  At the sink, I started to apply the shampoo.  I rubbed the shampoo into my head over and over until my head was all covered with the shampoo.  I then let it sit for about a minute.  After the shampoo sat for a little bit I washed it out in the sink. I rinsed it out with a cup. Next, I applied conditioner which smelled like grape too.  I squeezed a small amount into my hand.  After that I rub the conditioner into my hair. I rubbed the condition into my head over and over until my head was all covered with conditioner.  I usually let this sit for longer.  So, it sat on my hair for two minutes this time.  Then I turned the water back on cold with a little hot.   I rinsed it out with a cup.\n",

Last week I had fallen asleep on the couch when I dreamed that a bell was ringing.  Suddenly I realized it was the phone and sprung off the couch to run to the desk and pick it up.  The phone I picked up was a cordless phone, so I had to push the Talk button before answering.  \"Hello, Josh speaking...\" I said into the phone in my most professional sounding voice.  My Grandma Mary was on the other end and she wanted to talk to my dad.  \"Dad isn't home yet, Grandma, can I take a message for him?\"  Grandma asked me to ask Dad to call her when he got home.  I told her that I would, said good bye and hung up the phone.  Before I forgot, I took a piece of chalk from the chalkboard near the phone and wrote: 'Dad Grandma would like you to call her.'

Being a new home, all of the walls in the house were eggshell white. It's nice, pleasant, light but, a little boring. So, we decided we were going to add what is called an accent wall in the dining room. We would paint one wall a burnt orange color while all of the other walls in the dining room would stay white. It would just be something to add color, to draw attention. So, while I stayed home and moved all of the furniture away from the wall, and threw a blanket over everything, my wife went down to the store and bought the paint. While she was gone, I also cleaned the wall so no dirt or anything would be trapped beneath the paint. The first step was to prime it. Primer is used to prepare the wall and helps the paint stay on the wall. I did around the edges while my wife used a roller to do the center. We then waited a day for the primer to dry, then switched jobs with the actual painting. I rolled the center while she cut in around the edges. It turned out beautifully. Only thing is, now my wife wants to do MORE painting.\n",

I have a glass circular window on my front door so I checked out the glass window to make sure it was safe to open up my front door before doing so.

We read the directions on the back of the box of cake mix . Then we get out everything needed to make the cake . We usually need eggs , cooking oil , and water or milk . We also need a cake pan , a large mixing bowl , a measuring cup , and a mixing spoon . Also it helps to make sure we have pot holders and a spatula . I pre-heat the oven to the temperature given in the directions . Then I grease or oil the cake pan so the cake does not stick to the pan . Usually the directions want me to add a little flour to the pan to coat the oil , but I like to use sugar instead because it does not leave the outside of the cake looking like flour . We start by carefully cracking the egg shell and pouring the egg into a small cup or bowl to make sure we do not have a bad egg . Then we pour it into the mixing bowl . If we need more than one egg , we do each one separately the same way . Then we measure out the amount of oil needed and pour it into the mixing bowl , too . Then my granddaughter mixes up the eggs and oil really well . Next , I measure out the amount of liquid -LRB- water or milk -RRB- called for in the directions . She adds the liquid to the egg and oil mixture and stirs it all up really well . Then we add the cake mix , a little at a time , stirring well to mix . Then I pour the cake batter into the baking pan and spread it evenly with a spatula . Next , I carefully put the cake pan into the oven and set a timer to check it to see if it is done . We check to see if it is done by putting a clean toothpick into the center of the cake . If it comes out with little or none of the cake batter stuck to the toothpick , it is done and ready to take out of the oven , using pot holders . If there is still gooey stuff on the toothpick , the cake needs to be baked a little longer and then tested again . We are eager to see how our cake turns out . We play games while we wait for it to cool . Then we taste a little piece before we put frosting on the rest of the cake . \n",

I got off the bike and sure enough the front tire was flat . Well that is bad but not as bad if the rear tire was flat and I had to take the chain off . I always carry a spare inner tube and have a pump on the frame of my bike . This was going to be easy as I have done this many times before . I loosened the lock nuts that hold the front tire in place and pulled the tire from the frame . I looked in my bike pack and found the tool that helps take the tire off the rim . This took all of 5 minutes . When I had that off I took the old inner tube and placed it in my backpack to patch later . I then fit the good inner tube inside the tire and in reverse order fitted the tire to the rim . I next took my pump and filled it up to the correct pressure . I put the tire back on the front fork and tightened the locking nuts and was on my way . I was n't even late for work .\n",

After I arrived at the airport I located my airline, Southwest, and checked in with the automatic check-in machine to get my boarding pass.  Next, I made my way to the dreaded security line.  As always, the lines were very long and I had to wait my way through the ropes that always make me feel like I am part of herd of cattle.  When I reached the checkpoint, I showed my ID to the security agent and placed my things into the x-ray machine.  I proceeded to the x-ray booth until I was told to proceed.

First, I found the best inclusive deal with an on-site Disney Resort, and booked a 7 night stay which also included Park Hopper Passes.  I called customer support several times to make dining reservations six months ahead of the date, as I knew they filled up quickly.  I went to our local bookstore and purchased several trip guides so I could research and plan the best itinerary for this special vacation.  I planned early mornings because of my kids, with lots of downtime in the afternoons and a few activities in the evenings.  Finally, as Christmas neared, I devised a way to surprise the children on Christmas morning.  I bought Mickey Mouse balloons, tied a letter explaining that we would be getting on a plane later that day, and wrapped it up in a large cardboard box with some Disney paraphernalia.  I tucked it away in a corner for them to find after the initial rush of opening Christmas presents, knowing it would be the best present of all!\n",

We got carrots, celery, and onions from the produce section. Then we picked up beef bullion and lentils from the dry-goods section, and finally we got some ham from the butchers. When I got home, I peeled the carrots and washed the rest of the vegetables. I then chopped all of them on a cutting board. I cut the meat with a different knife. Then I heated up the pot on the stove and melted some butter in the bottom of the pot. After the butter was melted, I browned the onions in the butter. They smelled so good when they were cooking! It made me very hungry. After the onions were browned, I added the rest of the veggies and cooked them until they were soft. I then added the ham and heated it through. Once that was done, I added water and bullion to make the broth, and then put the lentils in. Then the waiting began. I had to wait for 2 hours for the soup to finish cooking.

Lots of things can build up to make the shower dirty, such as soap scum, hardwater deposits, and general germs from being in a moist environment. Yesterday, I cleaned my shower and it only took about fifteen minutes. I put on my rubber cleaning gloves and grabbed a clean sponge. I grabbed my favorite antibacterial bathroom cleaning gel, and squirted it on the sponge. I dampened the sponge with a bit of water, and proceeded to scrub all over the shower, making sure to reach all the walls, the corners, and the floor.

It is easy to squeeze fresh orange juice by hand, using a small bowl and large metal spoon.  First, cut the oranges in half, then over the bowl, cup a half-piece in one hand and grind the spoon in the middle of the orange's flesh, rotating or spinning the spoon several times to press the juice into the bowl.  Repeat this for all the orange halves, and the bowl has your fresh juice. After all the pieces have been squeezed with the spoon, you can still squeeze each piece by hand to get the last few drops out. A minimum of four navel oranges will yield about one cup of fresh juice. It may be best to purchase a bulk bag of oranges, as they are usually less expensive  overall than just buying  a few oranges.\n",

I realized after about 10 minutes into my ride that I had a very bad flat tire . Thankfully I carry the proper tools and items with me to fix it . I pulled off the road and opened my bag with my tools . After removing the tire and the tube inside , I used my tools to put a brand new tube inside of the tire . I checked it to make sure that I had aligned everything correctly and after ensuring that I did , I placed the tire back onto the bike . I then used my portable pump to make sure that I had the proper amount of air pressure inside of it , because I did n't want another flat . After checking everything twice , I was on my way again . It was an easy fix .\n",

I took it home and seasoned it with a little salt and pepper and a mixture of soy sauce, honey and some dijon mustard that I had mixed together.  I turned my oven on to broil.  I sprayed some cooking spray onto the pan so my fish wouldn't stick.  I put the pan into the oven and after four minutes used a small brush to brush on more of the sauce.  I let it cook for another four minutes.  I removed the pan and used a fork to see if the fish was done.  It was, so I turned off the oven.  I removed the fish from the pan and put it onto a plate with some rice and broccoli to round out the meal.\n",

It can be difficult to keep track and remember to pay them all so I have picked a date, the 3rd of each month. On the 3rd of each month I pap all 5 bills. This way I never forget because when you forget you usually have to pay a fine. I write a check and drop in into my manager's office before I go to work the morning of the 3rd. At work I go on the internet, login to online banking and pay my 2 credit card bills. At lunch I take a walk into town and I pay my electricity and phone bill in there.

My shoulders were tight, my head was constantly hurting and my muscles were sore. I decided to treat myself to the sauna. I looked online and found a local place with good reviews. I bought a 60 minute massage and sauna treatment off a local coupon page. I got dressed in my finest yoga attire and headed out the door. When I entered the spa, it was playing calm music, smelled like fresh water and was instantly calming. I met with the lady at the front desk who guided me back. First, I would have a relaxing hot stone massage, and then I would spend time in the sauna. The massage was relaxing, but the sauna was too hot for me. I felt like I could not breathe well.

I got the plants out from pots carefully with roots. In one part, I planted all plants,  equally spacing between them. Covered the roots carefully with dirt. Pour some water on it and secured them on their place. On the other part of the vegetable garden, I dug the long row for planting the seeds. I made 2 rows to plant the seeds. covered them with dirt and sprinkled some water on them. I made sure there were no weeds around. Put net on plants so birds do not eat them away.\n",

My friends and I were excited to cook the fish together afterwards, because we were feeling very hungry. At dinnertime, we started to prepare the fish for cooking by scaling the fish. We took a sharp knife and used the knife to take the scales off of the fish. We also cut the heads of the fish off, and then did the best we could to de-bone the fillets. My friend turned on the grill, and we decided to grill the fish in foil packets as our method of cooking. We placed the fish in squares of aluminum foil, added some olive oil, sprinkled them with salt and pepper, and then sealed up the foil. We put the packets on the grill and cooked them over the flame for ten minutes. When the fish was all cooked through, we dug in!\n",

Paying your bills on time is important, so the best thing they do right away is to write each one down in a notebook, when all the bills are due for payment.  That way, they know what times they have to go online and pay them. Next, they make sure money is in the bank, so that when they pay the bills, the money goes to bills the right way.  Then they pick a bill, and go online to the website for that bill, and login with their id for that bill.  They put in their amount they want to pay and hit the pay button, and it takes it out of their bank, the amount that they want to go to that bill.  They do this for each one of their bills that are due, every two weeks.  They are happy to do this every two weeks, to keep all the bills up to date and paid.\n",

Before I left for work in the morning I pulled the tuna steaks out of the freezer and put them in the refrigerator to thaw so they were not frozen when I cooked them. I heated my oven to broil and sprayed a cast iron skillet with non-stick spray. The way I like to prepare tuna steaks is to rub them with olive oil and sprinkle them with garlic salt and smokehouse pepper on both sides. I put the skillet in the oven and set the timer for five minutes, after five minutes I flipped them and put them in the over for another five minutes. When they were done cooking I put them on a plate to rest for a few minutes before eating them. I scrubbed whole potatoes and wrapped them in wet paper towels. I put them in the microwave and cooked for six minutes, flipping them over halfway through the cooking time. When the potatoes are soft I put them on plates, cut them open and put some salt and sour cream on them to eat. I ate my tuna steak and potato with a glass of water.\n",

The machine gave me the amount I put in back, in quarters. I looked for empty washers, finding a whole row was free. I went back to my car and got out my basket of dirty clothes as well as my laundry soap. I divided my clothes in to piles. Lights, dark clothes, and white clothes. Once I had them all in the machine, I took the cap off my laundry soap. I filled the cap to the very top  then pored it into each washer, three in all. I put the quarters in the machine and they began washing. I waited while they finished washing. Once the machine stopped spinning, I divided the clothes again. The ones I could dry I put in a dry and the clothes that do not dry, I hung on hanger. I put money into the dryer and waited for them to dry.

There was a fish food dispenser near the pond which would allow a person to buy a handful of fish food for fifty cents.  I placed two quarters in the slot and turned the crank to dispense the fish food while I held my hand under the dispenser's outlet.  I got a large handful of fish food.  I gave some to each of my nephews and we proceeded to throw the food into the water.  It was fun to watch the fish eat the food.  The bigger fish ate first, but after a while the smaller and faster fish started darting in to get the food before the big fish could get to it.

My friend and I got in the car and we drove to a nearby store that had the movie.  We got out of the car and brought our wallets with us.  We clicked the screen on the booth until we picked the movie we wanted.  When we decided we wanted it, we put our card in the booth and it gave us a DVD to borrow.  We took it home and watched it that night.  The next day, we didn't want to see it anymore so we wanted to take it back.

Ignoring the lure of the coffee maker I headed across the kitchen and opened the breadbox. There it was, one perfect, untouched loaf of nutty, grainy Italian bread. I found my bread knife after a bit of a search and started slicing. Sawing through the thick crust and trying not to squash the delicate insides, I measured off four thin slices. Now the question was whether to toast them in the toaster or the oven. It was cool outside so I opted for the oven. Taking out a cookie sheet I covered it with foil, spread the bread out on the foil and put some butter in the microwave to melt. Once the oven was ready I set the pan inside and turned the broiler up. The butter melted and once ready I drizzled it lightly over the bread. I stood in anticipation as the top of the bread slowly crisped and turned brown and waited for the perfect moment to snatch it from the oven. The bread smelled and looked amazing. I rescued it from the broiler and waited eagerly for it to cool enough to eat.\n",

I reached to the far back for the juicer. I hadn't used it in months because oranges had been so expensive, but the price had finally come down. I took a knife and cut one of the oranges in half. I set one half down and too the other into the palm of my hand. Holding it not to tight and not to loose I pushed it down onto the slotted metal cone in the juicer. As I turned and pushed, bright orange liquid squirted into the pitcher. When it seemed like no more juice would come, I tossed the peal in the compost and picked up the other half. Then I repeated the process with the rest of the oranges until the pitcher was full. I grabbed a glass and poured myself a drink before putting the rest of the juice in the fridge.\n",

We parked our car at the train station in Newark and prepaid for weekend parking . I grabbed a small bag and we went to the ticket window to purchase our tickets . After that we just had to wait for our train to arrive and begin boarding . Once it was at the station we were so excited , we ran out to the platform and boarded one of the cars . We found seats quickly , unlike an airplane you just sit where you want . And then off we went ! The train seemed to stop a lot , there were so many more stations than I realized were out there .

Today, we decided we needed to hang the art work.  We knew just where to hang it--over the couch in the living room.  First, we unpackaged the painting.

I unhooked the sheets currently on my bed in one corner, and shimmied around to the side of the bed by the wall.  I then squeezed between the wall and the bed to unhook those sides of the sheets.  After unhooking every corner, I took the sheets and threw them in my dirty laundry basket.  Following this, I found a large open space and shook out the clean sheets to find out which side is long and short.  I then stretched the sheet from one corner to the opposite corner, and got the other sides tucked in.

I wash the dishes nightly usually because even though I'm single, I go through a lot of dishes. I don't like to fill the sink with water. Rather I just let the water run the whole time. I soap up a sponge and scrub each dish. I try to get the big messy things out of the way first. after I've scrubbed and rinsed a dish I place it on a dish towel on the counter to dry. I do the silverware last. Once everything is laid out I go ahead and take another dish towel and dry them off the rest of the way. Then I put everything back in its proper spot in the cabinets.

The dog always knows when it is morning that I will be feeding him and then we will be going for a walk after so he gets very excited and begins running around in circles.  While he is eating I will put my shoes on and brush my teeth.  After we are both done with our morning routine, I grab the dog's leash and put it on the dog.  His tail wags very fast because he loves going for a walk.  The dog and I start off slow in order to warm our muscles up.  We walk by Mr. Johnson's house with all the flowers and straight down the street to the corner where there is a small empty lot.  I let the dog off the leash briefly so he can run around the lot sniffing at everything. He loves to sniff all the plants and rabbit holes.  Then we come home. The dog loves his daily walk.\n",

We begin by bringing the clothes from the laundry room to the living room and sorting them by family member. Each family member takes their clothes and begins folding them. We try to do this as soon as we hear the dryer finish as this helps to prevent wrinkling. Everyone has their own system for folding clothes, but what is most important is to fold them neatly so that they can be stored in drawers or closets and easily found later when you want to wear them again. It's also important to take care and fold clothes neatly because this helps prevent wrinkles. As we fold our clothes, we stack them in stacks of similar items. For example, we place shorts in one stack and shirts in another stack. Folding clothes can also involve matching socks and stacking them. If you separate the types of clothes as you fold, this makes it easier when it is time to put the clothes away.\n",

The library was obviously closed and nobody was inside and no lights were on. Without looking to see if anyone was watching the two teenagers broke the door to the library and entered.

I drove around until I found an empty pump, and pulled into it. I got out and considered whether I should use cash or my card. I decided to use my card this time, so I pulled my wallet from my pocket, and my card from it, and swiped it at the pump. I placed my card back into my wallet and my wallet back into my pocket when I was done. I opened the hatch to my fuel land put the nozzle in. I squeezed the handle on the nozzle and the gas flowed through. I watched the gallons tick by on the screen until I had enough to fill the tank. This took a little bit of time. When it was done, I pulled the nozzle out and closed the little door. I got back into my car and turned the key.

The challenge was to pack all the necessary things in a single suitcase. Then I started to plan accordingly. I made a list of necessary things to pack for the trip. I started with the important documents and paperwork​ required for the business purpose, and then the essentials such as clothes, toothbrush, a comb etc. I took as minimum number of clothes as possible. I put all the paperwork in a sealable file. First I put the clothes into the suitcase, followed by the paperwork and placed things like pen, toothbrush etc inside the small pockets provided in the suitcase and also the travel tickets. Packing clothes was the main challenge as it took more space. I rolled some clothes and folded some so that they take as less space as possible. At the end I put some folded clothes as they secured the fragile items beneath them. Finally I closed the suitcase and began with the trip.\n",

I opened the pantry and took out a bag of hot dog buns. I opened the refrigerator and took out Ketchup and mustard and a small onion. Very carefully I sliced the onion into small pieces. Once the water in the pot began to boil, I placed two hot dogs in the water to cook. This didn't take very long, only a few minutes. When the hot dogs were ready, I opened a bun a placed a hot dog inside. I squeezed a squiggly line of mustard all the way down the hot dog and did the same with the ketchup. I sprinkled onions across the top of the hot dog. Finally! My hot dog was ready to eat.\n",

I went down to the barber shop and just as I should of known , coming in on a Saturday was not one of my most brightest ideas in hindsight . There was quite a crowd , but I figured I was already here so I might as well just wait . I went over and put my name down under my barber , Bill , who has been cutting my hair for the past 10 years . As I waited I grabbed a Sports Illustrated and sat down and began to read how the Pirates were doing in the World Series . After about 20 minutes or so Bill called my name up and asked me what kind of hair cut I wanted . I told him to stick with the usual and he put the big barber apron around me and began to cut my hair while we talked about life and caught up on what has been going on since the last time I saw him , which was about a month ago . Afterwards my haircut was done and I looked great ! We went up to the register and I paid him and gave him a good tip , then was on my way . \n",

The last time I cooked a meal, I went to the kitchen and slowly got out everything I need first and then began to cut the vegetables on the cutting board. The process was slow, but relaxing. I went from vegetable to vegetable, moving slowly. Everything was evenly cut and when baked, was delicious. When I chopped up the onions, I felt my eyes start to water, but as I cut everything, I felt that my meal was getting better and better. After cutting everything and making my meal, I cleaned the cutting board and started to throw away and scraps. It felt amazing to cook a meal from scratch and use freshly cut vegetables. I enjoyed this experience and had a great time doing it. This was my best way to cut vegetables.\n",

Next I went to the clothes section and picked out a few dressed to try on. I went into the dressing room and tried on the three dressed I had picked out. There was one that I liked but it was too big. I went and got the right size and tried it on. I put it back on the hanger and walked to the check out counter.

This train was different , it was a double-decker or a train with two floors . We got to our seats and to the side was huge windows that went from the back of the train car to the front . I could n't believe how incredible all the trees and birds looked . Then we got to the observation car . I did n't even think this type of car existed . The train car was all class except for the floor and the lower parts of the wall , above was all glass . Then we rode in the observation and watched as the rain fell down .

I pulled into the gas station with the pump on my driver's side since that's where my tank fills and turned off the car. The gas station I went to uses points that I earned at the grocery store so I entered my loyalty number and had 27 cents off a gallon which was great! I swiped my debit card to pay and I popped the fuel door with a level inside my door and unscrewed the gas cap. I chose the type of gas I use (87) and put the nozzle in my tank. I squeezed the handle and let the gas fill the tank until it automatically stopped because it was full. I carefully removed the nozzle from the fuel tank, replaced it on the pump and screwed the gas cap back on tightly and closed the fuel door.

In order to iron my clothes, I always take them out of the wash and place them in a basket. After placing them in the basket, I pick out the articles of clothing that I want to iron and take out the drying board and put it in the back room in the basement. After unfolding it, I first place a shirt on the board and slowly iron it, moving from the top to bottom. I always do this in a slow pace and make sure every wrinkle is out before I move on. This process is always slow, but I eventually get everything unwrinkled. After ironing, I put everything onto a hanger and put it in my room.\n",

My favorite is minestrone. I use my cast iron dutch oven which is perfect to make soup. I start with vegetable stock and crushed tomatoes and put in onions, carrots, celery and potatoes with some herbs; generally oregano and a bay leaf. I let them simmer on medium since they all take awhile. When the vegetables that I've been cooking are soft I like to add zucchini and green beans which don't take long to cook at all and I add a can or two of drained white beans. Some people put pasta in their minestrone but I don't. I let it simmer for another 15-20 minutes and stir in a bag of spinach right when I turn the heat off. It is so good to serve with a little parmesan cheese and I add salt & pepper.\n",

First I went into the refrigerator and took out three eggs from the carton. I got a large mixing bowl from the cupboard and cracked the eggs into the bowl, being careful not to get any of the shell into the bowl. I added some of my favorite things to put in scrambled eggs: some cheddar cheese, bacon, and a little salt and pepper. I put a pan onto the stove, heated it up to medium, and added a little butter. When the pan was hot, I poured the egg mixture into the pan. Using a whisk, I stirred the eggs, until they were no longer runny, and were lumpy. I put them on a plate and added some hot sauce, since I like them to be extra spicy. I ate them, read the news, and drank a big glass of orange juice to go with it.\n",

I washed the sheets and pillowcases this morning, so I had to take everything completely off the bed and wash it. When the sheets and pillowcases were dry, I started to make the bed. I first put on the fitted sheet, starting in one corner and tucking it under the mattress, then I did the same to each side, stretching the sheets and leaving it without wrinkles. By this time Shadow was aware of what was going on. I began to put the bed sheet on the bed, and Shadow jumped up to hide underneath. As I tucked the sheet under the end of the bed, we played hide and seek, with Shadow trying to playfully attack my hand. After she got bored with that, I put the comforter back on the bed, and flattened it out so it was smooth. I then put the pillowcases back on my pillows and assembled them neatly on the bed.\n",

I walked in and put a stopper in the bathtub drain , turning on a mix of hot and cold water and checking the temperature after a couple of seconds to make sure it was just right - I like my water a little bit hot , but not too hot ! After sitting and waiting for several minutes for the bathtub to fill , I turned it off and got in . After relaxing for a few minutes , I grabbed the body wash and rag I keep on the corner of the bathtub . I lathered it up and washed my arms , my legs , my back , and my front , letting the water in the tub rinse off any soap when I was done with a part . After that , I pulled the stopper and drained the tub , used the towel hanging in the bathroom to dry myself off , and put on a fresh , clean pair of clothes . \n",

Next, we put out plates for each person that would be coming. We also put out napkins for our guests to wipe their mouths with. We laid our silverware on top of the napkins. This consisted of forks, salad forks, spoons, and butter knives. We put glasses with ice above each plate. Next, we laid out all of the dishes that we would be serving for the dinner. This included large bowls of spaghetti with meatballs, garlic bread, steamed broccoli, and a garden salad. We set out dressings for the salad as well. Lastly, we put out a large angel food cake, which we cut into eighths so that it would be easier to serve. The finishing touch was a vase of decorative fresh flowers in the middle of the table.\n",

She said the doctor could see me this morning. I rushed to get to the doctor's office in time for my appointment. I checked in at the receptionist's desk. They wanted me to pay for the doctor visit before seeing the doctor, so I did. Since I made an appointment I did not have to wait long to see the doctor. But I did have to wait a little while in the examination room. The nurse took my blood pressure an temperature. I had a fever of 101 degrees.

I stood on the curb waving my arm from under my umbrella for what seemed like an eternity. In all actuality, it was probably only two minutes, but the cold, wet air seemed to slow time down immensely. Finally, a cab stopped to pick me up. I quickly got in and made sure to shake my umbrella out before lowering it into the car so that I did not get the floor wet. The cab driver asked where I wanted to go, and I informed him that I had a job interview in twenty minutes sixteen blocks over. He said, \"That's going to be a tight squeeze on time, but I'll try.\" As I glanced fanatically down at my match, he weaved in and out of traffic to get me to my destination.

We looked around and found that the lawn with the trees in back would make a good location.  I went around and gathered up all the kids who where playing around and brought them to the lawn. It was good that the sun was covering the lawn so everyone's face would be shown well.  I lined up the kids, but some where too tall and blocking the kids in back.  I found the taller kids and lined then up and then grabbed the smaller ones to stand in front.  Two rows, one tall in back and on small in front worked out pretty well.  With everyone in place, I stepped back and got the camera setup on the tripod.  A tripod helps keep the camera steady.  Everybody!  Smile! Look at me!  Snap and a very nice photograph.\n",

I chose a medium sized suitcase, since I didn't think I would need to bring that many items. I began by packing the clothes I wanted to bring. I find that the most efficient way to pack a suitcase is to roll the clothes, instead of fold. I packed shirts, shorts, pants, a couple of dresses, and two bathing suits. After all of this clothing was packed, I picked out which shoes I wanted to bring with me. Another good packing trick is to stuff your shoes with socks and underwear. Once I finished this, I packed a bag filled with toiletries - shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash, toothbrush, and toothpaste. Everything fit in my suitcase perfectly, with a little room to spare for souvenirs. I'm ready for my vacation!\n",

Instead, I have to eat a good enough amount of fruits and vegetables. Because of this, I include vegetables with every meal I eat. The most basic meal I eat with vegetables in it is a salad. I like to make my own instead of buying it already made, and this is more or less easy. I like to take whatever vegetables I want in my salad and put them on a cutting board. I usually like to use lettuce, cabbage, carrots, and tomatoes. After picking the amount of each vegetable I want to use, I use a large knife to cut each one into small pieces. I put all of these chopped vegetables into a bowl and mix them around. Then, I add any dressings I want, and I enjoy my salad.\n",

When I was done with that, I got out my card to pay for the gas.  After I swiped it, the machine told me to pick what gas I wanted.

I always begin by surveying my refrigerator and cabinets . What food do I already have and what do I need ? There are certain basic things I get almost every week . At this point I begin to make a written list to bring with . This week I also had a birthday party to shop for so extras like cake mix and a can of frosting went on my list . Once the list was done I headed to the store . It 's a short drive , and once there I grabbed a cart and begin to head down the aisles . Produce then canned goods then meats . After that on to dairy and dried goods , and even cleaning products . Finally it was off to the frozen aisles , I needed to get ice cream for the party ! With a full cart I went to the cash register , loaded all the food on the convener belt , and then paid for the groceries as a boy bagged everything . Another Saturday 's chore was done ! \n",

I found a sporting goods store and went in because my friend was an avid sportsman. In the store there was a display of football jerseys. I found one that was of my friend's favorite team. I took the item to the counter and paid the clerk for the purchase. He put my jersey in a box and then bagged it up. He handed me the receipt and told me to enjoy my day.

After we all finished eating and everyone had left the table I started to clear it. Starting with the plates. I carefully stacked the plates neatly in one stack. Then carefully placed this in the sink. Then I placed each glass on top of the next. And once they were all stacked I used the top cup to gather he spoons and knifes and forks in. Then careful not to spill or drop anything I placed them in the sink. Finally I was able to wipe down and clean off the table top, making sure nothing was sticky or wet. I then decided I would place a small glass vase in the center of the now cleared kitchen table, with a few wildflowers from our own backyard garden.\n",

I say this to illustrate the point that after this work out I am in great need of a bath . I come home and welcome my ritual of taking a bath . I get my phone out and find my favorite Pandora station that matches my current mood . I then get the water rolling at a hot temperature . I get undressed and in the tub . I like to sit there for a while and reflect while I relax . After a few minutes I 'll lather my hair and clean it out . I might drain the tub and put in more water .

I usually start by picking maybe about a dozen of nice oranges when I go grocery shopping. After I get home, I clean the oranges with a damp cloth and cut them in half. Different people do this differently, but I usually use the manual orange juicer. It requires more work but in the end i think the effort is worth it. So using the manual juicer, I just press each half of the oranges gently and twist it so all the juices come out into the container underneath. If the orange is sweet enough I don't bother add any sugar, but sometimes if I want just a tad of sweetness, I just add honey instead. It's really nice, sweet and has a unique flavor. It's hard to be patient, but definitely the orange juice tastes better cold, so I put it into a jug, or bottle, or any container I can find and put it in the fridge for a few hours. If I really feel thirsty I just add a couple cubes of ice and drink right away.\n",

I dumped a cupful of scent booster into the washing machine and threw in two laundry detergent pods. I added my dark laundry to one machine and repeated the process in another machine where I put my light colored laundry. I put fabric softener in the drawer for detergent, bleach and softener and put in enough quarters for the machine to run. I chose to wash both dark and light in warm water. When the washing machines were finished, I pulled my laundry out into a cart and rolled the cart to the wall where the dryers are. I shook each piece and sat a few pieces aside that I was going to hang up to dry. After adding the clothing to the dryer, I put several dryer sheets in. I chose to dry at high heat and put in enough quarters for thirty minutes. When my clothes were dry I put them into baskets to take home.

Then, I quartered the tomatoes.  After I cut the tomatoes, I sliced the cucumbers after I peeled them. Lastly, I diced the onion. The onion made my eyes water!

I will take off my gym clothes and wrap one of the towels they have there around my waist, and use the flip flops I keep in my gym locker.  The sauna has a glass door that you can't see through because of all the steam.  I open the door and I can immediately the heat.  The walls, ceiling, and floor are wood and there is a metal heater in the center with very hot coals in it.  Built against each wall are two rows of wooden benches.  They wrap around the room so there is plenty of room to sit or lay down.  A few of my friends are there and they wave to me as I come in and sit down near them.  Every one is relaxing quietly in the heat and I am already red and sweating a lot. I sit in there as long as I can stand it, before I leave and jump up and rush out and into the cold water pool they have next to it.  Its feels so refreshing but I get out before I start getting cold.  My skin is red and tingly and I feel great so I head back into the sauna to do it again.

We got dressed and dolled up early in the evening.  She and I joined a few of our friends at one of our favorite local restaurants.  We ate and had a few drinks and had a great time.  Later, we called a cab.  We waited outside the restaurant for the cab to arrive.  We jumped in and let the cab bring us to the local club.  We walked in after we were carded and we got in through the door.  We found a table in the corner and sat down.  We each had a couple drinks and then got onto the dance floor.

Coincidentally, a younger cousin was having his birthday just one day after mine, and since it was on a Friday, my family thought it would be the perfect day to throw a party. We knew who would be going to the party, since it was a pretty small, family-only party. Our aunt came to my house with a lot of food, including a cake for my cousin and I and some hot dogs and burgers to throw on the grill. My younger cousin, brother, and several other cousin hung out outside while my brother manned the grill. The younger kids spent time inside the house watching movies and playing video games, and the adults were all chatting at the table. Overall, it was a very fun night.\n",

He set it on the stove, then carefully measured out the correct amount of milk, pouring it from the measuring cup into the pan. He turned the burner to medium, then waited. Waiting was the hardest part. He smelled the sickly smell of warming milk as the contents became hotter and hotter. He stirred it with a wooden spoon, occasionally - just for something to do. He knew it wasn't strictly necessary. He listened to the milk; he could hear it sort of sizzling along the sides of the pan. He knew from experience that he wouldn't have long to wait now. Soon, he a the milk at a full boil - the smell was very strong now - and he poured it into the mug. Instant hot cocoa was best when you used hot milk.\n",

So I decided to go to the local library and get one of the old fashioned paper books that I had not read . I went and looked around the shelves and talked to the librarian and other customers about what was good to read . After picking up a few and reading the summary I finally found one of interest and took it to the checkout line . While checking out the book the librarian noticed the handgun on my hip and we had a great conversation about the importance of being ready , willing , and able to protect yourself in any situation and in any locality .

Then, I placed the pot of water on the stove and turned the heat to the highest setting. While waiting for the water to boil, I got out a few tea bags that I would use in the water to make my gallon of tea. I also got out a pitcher and placed a few ice cubes at the bottom. Once the water was boiling, I placed the tea bags in the water and turned off the stove. The teabags soaked in the water for about ten minutes.

I squeezed several lemons into a shallow bowl and put the salmon in the lemon juice, I let it soak for five minutes then flipped it and let it soak for another five minutes. In the meantime I had preheated the oven to broil. I sprayed an iron skillet with cooking spray and sat the salmon in the skillet. I put the salmon in the oven for five minutes, removed it and flipped it and put it back in the oven for another five minutes. When I pulled the salmon out it looked done so I squeezed the juice of another lemon on it and put it onto a plate.

We finally were getting rain that we need badly, but it wasn't too hard. I drove, and it took us about 15 minutes to get there. We walked in and were greeted by the hostess. I guess because of the weather the place was not too busy. We got a booth by the window which is what we always prefer.  My husband got his usual starer plate. A big heap of crab legs. I head to the Hibachi bar, because I have to keep an eye on how much sodium I eat. They have a fantastic variety of fresh meats, seafood, and vegetables. I choose all my favorites and then hand the plate to the chef, Tom.  He stir fries my food, hands me my plate, and off I go with tasty hot food.  I stopped at one of the other bars and got some white rice to go with it.  I then joined my husband.  We both enjoyed our meal very much as usual.  After his plate of crab legs was finished he then went to the other bars and got more typical style Chinese food.  When we were done the waitress brought our check, but by this time the rain really started coming down hard.  Everyone in the restaurant waited for it to let up before going outside.  We probably had to wait 15-20 minutes.  We played games on our cell phones while waiting.  Finally we left, and I drove us back home.\n",

Everyone seemed to really love his cooking, especially when it came off of that grill. He would usually prepare for one of these little barbecue parties a day in advance by making sure that he had charcoal and lighter fluid to get the grill started. Depending on what was being made, my dad would figure out just how much charcoal he would need to use, and would lay it out inside the grill. He'd then use paper from the bag of charcoal, light the paper up, and spray it with lighter fluid to ensure that the charcoal caught fire. Once he knew that the coals were hot enough, he would begin cooking. Whether it was burgers, hot dogs, ribs, chicken, or steak, my dad always knew how to grill it.\n",

This was a perfect time for both of us so we booked the tickets. We arrived at the theater 30 minutes early so we wouldn't be rushed. First we went to the ticket booth to pick up our tickets. We then walked to the concession stand to buy some snacks to eat during the movie. I bought popcorn and coke, while my friend got nachos and a slushee. It was really expensive! After buying our snacks, we decided to go into the theater. Because we were still early, we had no problem finding a seat. Both of us like to sit right in the middle of the theater, because it has the best view. The previews started right on time and they were really exciting.

I ripped up some pieces of bread and started to throw them into the river. As I saw more and more fishes jumping, I continued to throw more food into the water. I could see many fish jumping out of the water and eating the food. This was a fun experience and I went through a couple pieces of bread by giving them to the fishes.

I follow the same routine each day and I start by working a nice lather of shampoo through my hair.  Once the shampoo is rinsed out I use a liberal amount of conditioner and really work it through my hair, using my fingers to work out any tangles my curly hair has gotten into.  While the conditioner sets I use my favorite tea tree soap and a louffa to get my body clean.  Some days I will shave after using the soap, and then I will brush my teeth before making sure I am all rinsed of the soap.  Now it is time to rinse the conditioner out of my hair and run a comb through it.

As soon as I bought the tickets, I realized that the game was far from where I lived and that I would need to buy a plane ticket since it was too far to drive my car.

The best way to heat your milk is to bring it to a boil on the stove top. Pour your milk into a pan and turn the burner on. The burner will cause the milk to heat up and it will start to bubble. Once you have rolling bubbles of milk you know your milk is boiling. Mix in your cocoa and sugar to the bailing mixture. Make sure that the sugar and cocoa dissolve well. Turn off your burner and let stand to cool before pouring into your cup or drinking it. This is a much tastier way of drinking hot chocolate.

Mary gets up on the stool in the kitchen, and helps pour the soup from the can her mom opened, into a big bowl. She stirs the soup and adds some water as well. She puts a whole cup of water in the soup, and stirs it again. Then, she adds salt and pepper to her soup, and puts her soup in a pan  on the oven to boil.  When the soup has reached a boiling point, her mom takes the soup off the oven, and pours it into a bowl.

I have 3 different brands of food that I feed to my fish. The first is to help them digest well, the second is for nutritional value and the third is to boost immunity so they don't become easily sick. I begin by opening the top of the fish tank and shaking some of the first brand of food into the tank. I watch as the fish swim hungrily around the tank and swallow the food. Then I shake in some of the second food and make sure the fish consume as much as they can. I repeat this process at the end of the day, but give them the third brand as well.\n",

The wait staff was very pleasant and well mannered and it was a quiet ambient setting. I decided to order steak ( I normally order fried chicken everywhere I go ) I wanted it medium rare and made that very clear to the waiter, I saw him jot it down when I said it. I waited about 40 minutes which seemed strangely long given there was only 2 other couples in the restaurant one of which already had their food. My steak comes out and it looks delicious, I thank the waiter and he leaves. I pick up my fork with my left hand and my knife with the other. I begin to cut into the steak and realize it's taking more effort than I expected. I realized why; it was because my steak was very well done, and dry. I figured I would at least taste it and give it a chance, I don't like to complain. But the steak tasted bland, dry, and a bit tough. I called the waiter over and politely explained to him that I knew it wasn't his fault, but the steak was not made to order. He offered to bring me another steak, but I sent the steak back and told him I'd rather just have the fried chicken.\n",

On Sunday, I decided to try a new recipe for my omelettes. I went to the store, got my ingredients, and brought them home. I laid everything out on my counter top and got the necessary tools. I cracked the eggs along with a small amount of water into a bowl and beat them until they were all mixed together. Then, I added some salt and pepper to the egg and mixed it again. Then, I heated some butter in a pan on the stove. Once the butter had melted, I poured in the egg mixture until it filled the entire pan. I then added some cheese and bacon bits into the pan and mixed it in. I let it cook for a while and then flipped it.

First, we thought about a good location, and decided to go to a state park not very far away. The park has lots of picnic tables, plus trails for hiking and other activities we could do after eating. Next, I got out my cooler, while my friend started making sandwiches. We put some ice in the bottom of the cooler. After that, we put in some bottled water, then potato salad and fruit, stored in their own sturdy plastic containers. The sandwiches went on top, where they wouldn't get squished by the heavier items. We packed the cooler in the trunk of my car, along with some sunscreen and bug spray, and drove to the state park. We parked near a picnic area and chose a table under a shady tree. While we ate our meal, we watched the wildlife nearby. Squirrels played in the tree, birds flew overhead, and a deer cautiously crept out of the woods to graze at the edge of the clearing. When we finished eating, we picked up all of the trash and put it into a bag. We dumped the ice out of the cooler to make it lighter, then put the plastic containers inside. We carried the cooler and the trash back to the car and put it away before going hiking.\n",

He gets fed on a schedule, so I know if he starts crying at around 12pm it's because it's time for his bottle. My nephew takes formula so first I have to mix the formula with water and put it in the microwave. Then I have to take it out and shake it til it's well mixed. I test the temperature of the formula on my wrist to make sure it's not too hot. Once it's at the right temperature I sit down with the baby. I cradle him in my arms and place the bottle in his mouth. He immediately starts drinking. I have to sit until he drinks a certain amount of ounces. When he is done I burp him by placing him on my shoulder and patting his back.\n",

I begin the process by going around the house and picking up everything that I find lying around on the ground. I put it all away where it belongs and get out the broom and dustpan. Then, I sweep the floor until all of the dust is swept up and thrown away. I then put the broom away and prepare a mop bucket. I usually add a polishing agent to the water to keep my floors looking nice. I then dunk the mop into the bucket and begin to mop the floor. I go from room to room until every area of my house besides the bedroom is clean. Then, I get out the vacuum, plug it up, and vacuum the carpet in the bedroom.

We would talk about how happy we were to spend time with family.  We would be grateful at being invited to their home.

He had been fond of the job he had been doing. He did not like his new position at all, but no one would listen to him. He needed to relax, and headed over to the Comedy section in the store. He browsed the racks of DVD's, and finally selected a stand up comedy routine. The guy on the front seemed happy enough. Maybe, I will feel better after I watch him, Paul thought. He took the empty case to the girl at the counter. She asked him for his phone number, and he quietly rattled it off to her. The girl informed him that there was money past due on his account for past rentals. Paul had only brought enough money for the one DVD. He really wanted it, and told her so.

I thought carefully about the type of tree I wanted to grow , I needed something with lots of leaves that would grow quite fast as I could n't afford to buy a tree that was already grown . I did some research on the internet and decided that I would like a Japanese Maple tree with red leaves . I drove to the garden center and made my way to the tree section , where there were lots of lovely small Japanese Maples for sale already growing in pots . I found someone who worked there to advise me on the best way to plant the tree and how to care for it . After I had paid for it and chosen some special compost for trees , they helped me load the car and I drove home to plant it . I selected a good spot in the garden where it would have room to spread out and went into the garage to get my spade . I dug a hole wide and deep enough for the entire pot to fit into , and I laid the pot on it 's side , gently tugging on the tree to remove it from the pot . Once it was free , I shook the roots a little to free them up and planted the tree in the hole I had dug . Then I packed the sides of the roots with the compost , making sure the trunk stayed vertical as I was doing this . When I had finished I watered the new tree really well , making a puddle around the base of the trunk with my garden hose . Then it was time to sit back and imagine in a few years I would have a big leafy red maple providing lots of shade and color . \n",

He and his dad decided they would be going to a local state park do some primitive camping.  The primitive camping sites were for tents only,  and Luke had just gotten a new two person tent for his birthday.  Dad called the campground and reserved a site for this evening.  Luke was so excited he started packing his bags.  He knew he'd need his tent and sleeping bag, that was a given, but he was trying to remember the other things that would be important.  Dad reminded him of how bad the bugs were in the woods, and that he would want to bring several changes of clothes in case they got wet while fishing.  Oh yes, fishing gear, that's what he had been forgetting.  Luke went to the garage and gathered his fishing rod, tackle, and his favorite lucky hat in a pile.  Dad packed more practical things like toothbrushes, flashlights, and snacks.   They packed all of the gear in to Dad's truck and took off for their adventure.  When they arrived, they paid the park ranger for their camp site, and drove out toward the woods. They were excited to find a nice flat piece of ground with a fire pit, and lots of trees.  This was the beginning of an amazing summer.\n",

We talked to our family members, my parents, my in-laws, my husband's grandparents and my sisters, to see if they would like to join us. They all decided that they would come along. We needed a reservation for 12 people. Since we didn't just want to show up at Chili's hoping they would have enough room to seat us right away for 12 people I called that day to make a dinner reservation for 6pm that night. It was pretty simple. The girl just took down my name, the amount of people I needed a reservation for and the time we would be there. When we arrived at Chili's at 6pm our table for 12 people was ready! Our dinner went along great and my daughter really had a great time for her birthday.\n",

Because there aren't any video stores around anymore, I checked on my tv to see what was available for me to rent on cable. I also checked to see if there are any Red Boxes in the area where I can rent a DVD for $1.20. I decided to go to a Red Box to get a DVD. I drove to the grocery store down the street and found the Red Box. I used the Red Box to look through the available movies. I sorted the movies by what came out most recently. Many of the movies were gone because they were rented by someone else. I finally found one I thought sounded interesting. I selected Hidden Figures because I had not seen it yet. After I made my choice, I used my debit card to pay the $1.20 fee, added my email address to get my receipt, and finished the transaction. The DVD came out of the slot on the machine and I took it and drove home.\n",

I drove to the park and met my three other friends there.  One of my friends was nice enough to bring some cookies so we had our sandwiches, or drinks and a nice dessert.  After eating my friend  showed me that he had brought a frisbee so we played a really fun game of frisbee at the park.

Then she played a country song which made me want to laugh because it was so awful. Then the priest said a few words. He was a funny man. Then we all went out to our cars and proceeded to the cemetery. It was hot and we knew Nan was loving watching all of us sweating in our black clothes.

We wanted to start with bedroom, which was most ugliest, specially because it has somehow darkwood color, and it literally looks like dark basement. First of all, we moved our all furniture to other rooms. Cleared up all walls. Then we spread plastic all over the floor, which covered every inch from wall to wall. and taped it on walls so it does not touch the floor at all. We chose teal color for my bedroom We used sand paper to scrap the walls. Then we used primer first, and it was white. That is like first coating to wall, so it becomes ready for more coating. other reason, to condition them prior to actual color. We let it dry for another day. Then we bought the color from office depot. We had some crushes, rollers, small brushes, wipes, towels. We had ladder. we started ceiling. For ceiling, we chose white color. First we finished with ceiling, then we  finished wall one by one using the rollers. It was not an easy task. My arms and shoulders were in pain every night. We gave equal pressure stroke from one direction to other. We finally were finished in 2 days. Then we let it dry for one day, and removed all the plastic, looked for any place that we might have missed. Then we gave fresh look to windows with white color. Finally we were done and brought the furniture in. My bedroom looked like brand new bride.\n",

I placed the food container back in its place for just a second, so that I could remove the top from the fish take. I then looked down into the tank to see if there was any debris that needed to be removed before the food was put into the tank. I used a cleaning fishnet to scoop the top of the water in order to remove small objects that were floating around at the top, dumping the debris into the garbage and resting the net with clean water from the faucet. I returned to the fishnet to its place behind the fish tank, then picked up the food and began sprinkling a small amount into the water. I looked down into the tank to see that the fish were making their way from the bottom to the top of the water in order to eat, and when I saw that some fish has swam to a side of the water surface that did not have any food, I sprinkled a little bit of the fish food on that side so they would not have to fight the other fish for food. Once I was satisfied that there was a sufficient amount of food spaced out so that all the fish could eat, then I put the food back in its place and put the top back on to the fish tank.\n",

We packed a cooler full of yummy snacks and cold drinks and we drove to the ocean. As soon as we got to the edge of the beach, I took off my shoes so I could walk in the sand and feel it on my toes! We carried our things to a spot close to the shore, but not too close! We arranged the chairs and the blanket under the umbrella, and put on lots of sunblock, so nobody would get a sunburn. I ran to the water and splashed around in the waves. Then I went back to the blanket and I made a castle out of sand. Later on, I buried my mom's legs in the sand.

I turned the heat to medium so the pan would be ready when I got my food out the refrigerator. I decided this morning I wanted an omelet and sausage, so I took out eggs and cracked them into a large bowl. After I whipped them smooth I greased up my pan and poured the eggs in pan. While I let that heat up I pulled out another pan and put it on another gas burner. I got out my sausage patties and put them in the pan. My eggs were ready to turn so I used my spatula to flip them. Now, my sausages were ready to be turned so used my tongs to spin them to make sure they cooked evenly. After I cooked my food completely I took them from the pan and put them on a plate.

I decided to give him some cough medicine so he can feel a little better. I get the cough medicine from the medicine cabinet, along with a measuring spoon. I keep the medicine in a safe place where my son can't drink it by accident. I read the instructions carefully, making sure to measure out the right amount of medicine into the spoon so I don't give my son too much or too little. Once I have the right amount, I go to my son and give him the medicine. I tell him to open wide and pour the medicine right into his mouth, making sure he swallows it all. The medicine doesn't taste very good, but he swallows it all down because he knows it'll help him feel better. Pretty soon, he's not coughing any more!\n",

I had a Red Velvet chocolate cake mix in a box and the blueberries required . I 'm too adventurous for my own good . I figured I 'd try it . I tossed the blueberries with sugar and put them in the baking dish . I then mixed butter and a little milk with the cake mix . I put it on top of the blueberries . I put it in the oven . It was supposed to be like a cobbler . The cake was pretty bad . The bottom was all watery and the cake mix was super mushy because of all the liquid . The first couple of bites were okay .

I was also scared that I wouldn't be able to take care of a dog, though, so I constantly asked my parents for pet fish. I asked for fish because I thought that they would be easy to take care of. When I was about 7 years old, my parents bought a huge aquarium and put it in our living room, and later that day, we went to the store and picked up some fish to put into it. Since I was the one who wanted pet fish, my parents gave me the responsibility of feeding them. Every now and then during the day, I would take the fish flakes that we bought from the same store and sprinkle enough into the tank for all the little fish to eat some.

I closed the bag back up using a twist tie and placed the slice of toast in a slot in the toaster. I plugged in the toaster on the counter, and pushed down the button that activated the toaster. The toast moved down inside the toaster upon pushing the button and began to cook as the parts inside the toaster heated up and glowed red. I adjusted the knob so that the toast would be perfectly cooked, not burnt, and waited for the toast to pop up. Once it was finished, the toast popped up and was hot and crispy. I placed it on a plate with rest of my breakfast and got the butter out of the fridge. Using a butter knife, I spread some of the butter on the toast.\n",

She said that it would be an easy job with my thick hair . I followed her back to the salon area , and she motioned for me to take a seat in a big chair . I sat down , and she put a cape around my shoulders to prevent hair from sticking to my clothes . She brought over a cart with a small tub on it , and told me to lean my neck back while she washed my hair . After shampooing my hair , she rinsed it out with water and put it up in a towel to let it dry . She rolled the cart away and came back with a comb and pair of scissors , and combed through my hair . She applied a special creme to my hair to help nourish it , and then started snipping away . Long pieces of my hair fell all around me to the floor . She turned my chair around so she could reach the hair in the front of my head , and when she was done she washed her scissors off .

Us kids were hanging out in the living room, one on the computer, another watching TV, another on their phone and I was finishing my school project. We all knew what she meant by bathroom cleaning; that meant we all were going to have clean the whole house staring with the bathrooms. I volunteer to clean the upstairs bathrooms because I know they are the easiest and cleanest to start with. My siblings give me the stink eye, when I walk upstairs to my chore assignment. That's why I am the oldest I whispered to them as I grabbed the cleaning products and smirked when they were salty about it. Because they got stuck with the rest of the house. I headed to the bathroom upstairs and sprayed the tub with the tub cleaner, and I let that soak. I sprayed the toilet with the toilet cleaner and let that soak and sprayed the sink with the disinfectant and let that soak. While everything was soaking I was listen to music. After a few minutes I rinse the tub down and the product did all the work for me, the shower looked good as new.  I scrubbed the toilet with the toilet scrubber and it was clean in no time. I wiped down all the surfaces with disinfectant, cleaned the mirrors, took out the trash and sprayed the bathroom with disinfectant. After twenty minutes, I was finished. So I headed to the kitchen for a snack, as the rest of my siblings were still cleaning away. That is why I always clean the bathrooms on cleaning day.\n",

First, I decided on a location to the painting. There was an empty wall beside of my closet where I though it would look very nice. I grabbed a pencil, a hammer, some measuring tape, and a nail from the garage. I marked the exact spot where I wanted it to hang and double checked it using the measuring tape. Once I was satisfied, I placed the nail in the wall with the hammer, making sure to move the hand holding the nail once it was in the wall. I grabbed the painting and found the small hook at the back used to secure it to the wall. Holding it by this, I carefully placed it on the wall and straightened it until it was level.\n",

I sauteed them until they were softened. While the vegetables were cooking I cracked three eggs into a bowl and whipped them with a fork until they were mixed and frothy. When the vegetables were softened I dumped the eggs into the pan and turned the heat to medium. When I saw the the sides were looking hardened, I carefully lifted one side and turned the pan to the side to let the runny eggs go underneath. After thirty seconds I very carefully flipped the egg mixture and was successful! I added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese and carefully slid the omelette onto a plate where I folded it over. I seasoned with some salt and pepper and it was delicious.\n",

Now, everybody has different choice. They were new movie releases. Like, Mama a horror film, middle school, The Accountant,, Deep water horizon, come and find me, The whole truth, The girl on the train. All sounded very good, and I know we have one common thing that we all like thriller or comedy movie. So I asked everyone to make one choice out of these 7 movies we selected. So I can make my list to sort it out. It worked, it ended with 2 movies. We all ended up with \" come and find me\" as we watched the main character before in \" Breaking bad\". So I put my rental car in slot, but it did not work first time, so I talked to customer service and then she gave me other card, and it worked, it was good choice.\n",

Upon arriving at the mattress store, we were approached by the salesman, who asked us what we were looking for.  We told him how much we hoped to spend and the type of mattress we liked and he showed us to the correct area of the store.  As we tried the different mattresses to get a feel of what we liked, we were embarrassed as our three children started jumping from mattress to mattress in excitement.  We hurried with our selection to limit the time our kids could horse around.  Once we found a good mattress, we talked with the clerk about how to pay for it, signed the papers and went home.  It will be delivered next week--yay!\n",

      " 406).I placed the laundry basket of freshly washed clothes on the folding table in the laundry room and started in.  I first sorted out types of clothes from the basket- shirts in one pile, pants in another, and socks and underwear in another.  I took a t-shirt out of the pile, flipped it over so that the back of the shirt was facing me and laid it out flat on the table.  I then folded the right arm straight down so that the arm of the shirt faced the middle, then the left side so that it looked like the arms were crossed on the shirt. Next step- carefully folding the bottom upward so that it met the shoulder line.  I picked it up, flipped it back over and the shirt was perfectly folded!  Boy this task was getting boring- I decided to do this while watching TV and moved the basket, and piles of clothing that were already folded to a nice comfy big chair, turned the TV on, found a favorite program and plopped down to continue the task of folding clothes.  Ahhh much better! Then came a pair of pants which I held up in front of me, folding the side-seems of the legs so that they met together at the legs.  Next, I folded the legs upward so that they met the top of the waist- perfect!  I put the pants in a stack of the same type of clothing that had already been folded and continued getting all those clothes folded and ready to put away.  Next came socks, find the mate to the sock needing to be folded, put them together and take one sock, folding the top over the other like you are making a cuff after you have put it on your foot, keep pushing the other sock in so that it looks like you have a small ball when you are done. Yaaay, socks are all done, now it's underwear next!  I pulled a pair of panties out of the basket, laid it out flat and then folded each side so that it met in the middle, then the bottom so that it to met in the middle then flipped it over, and started a pile of freshly folded underthings.  For things like bras, I folded the cups together, the back so that it fit inside the cup, and the straps down.  Soon with the help of glancing at the favorite TV program, the basket was empty, and laundry all folded- yippeeee!

She decided it was time to write to headquarters, because nothing was being done at store level to resolve the problems. She opened the word processing program on her computer and started a new page. She put her own address and the date in the top right corner and then entered the corporate address of the restaurant below and on the left. She started the letter with 'Dear Sir or Madam', not knowing for sure whether the reader would be a man or a woman. On the next line, she indented and communicated the problems she had on her most recent trip and the problems she had in the past. She explained what she had already said to managers in the restaurant and her disappointment that the problems had not been resolved. She asked that she be contacted in the future.

I got there fifteen minutes before my appointment, and told the woman behind the counter I had an appointment with Dr. Le. She smiled and told me to take a seat. I looked at an old magazine while I waited. Soon another woman came and told me they were going to take an X-ray. She led me back to a small room. There she put heavy vest on me that was almost like a blanket. Then she put a small film holder in my mouth and told me to hold still. She left the room for a minute, and I think I heard a click, but I didn't feel anything. Then she came back and led me to the dentist's chair. The dentist smiled, and asked me how I was feeling. Then she told me to open wide, and carefully looked at all my teeth. They were fine! She told me to keep brushing and flossing, and to come back to see her in six months.

I got 2 gallons of milk today and I wanted to make custard today, So I emptied it in big pan. I turned on my stove, and put on medium heat and put the pan on. after few minutes, I started to stir it, because if I will not stir it will start to stick to the bottom, because my milk was very cold when I put it in pan. So I  stirred it often to make sure it is not sticking to bottom  ONce the milk was warm enough then I stop stirring it so much, then I increased more heat. Most important thing at this time, bit to move away from stove to avoid unnecessary big mass. I kept stirring once in while, and with in few minutes, milk started to make bubbling noise. it started to boil, and I turned the heat down, other wise definitely it was going to overflow. It kept boiling and it reached desired consistency I turned it off.\n",

I had taken off the fitted sheet and the pillowcases and tossed them into the washer. As I was looking at my enticing bed, I could hear the dryer working on my bed sheets. So, I went to my closet and took out another bed sheet and pillow case set. I unfurled the fitted sheet and managed to get it around all four corners. I then took the pillowcases and put them on my two pillows. After finishing the bed sheet change, I passed out on my soft, comfortable, and now, clean bed for a night of sleep.

Tonight I did not feel like making another whole meal, having worked a long day. I put a medium sized pot on my gas stove top and filled it with the leftover chili. I added a little water and turned on the gas stove. It is an older stove, so I had to turn on the gas and then strike a match to get the flame started. Once the flame had started, I turned the flame down to medium and fished a wooden spoon out of the drawer. I stirred the chili every so often in between setting the table and pouring the water. I had to be careful not to burn it; that's what I had done last time. Soon the chili was hot and boiling.

It seemed like some days we spent more time almost dragging him instead of him walking along by himself. Eventually though he learned that when we grabbed the leash that we store by the front door, that it was time to explore the neighborhood together. So now we grab the leash and he comes running. We attach the leash to him to ensure that he doesn't get run off and get into trouble. After we attach the leash, we head outside and begin walking along the sidewalks in our neighborhood. Now that he understands what we are doing, he usually leads the way and there isn't a lot of tugging him along. In addition to a leash, we make sure to bring little baggies with us in case he needs to go to the restroom. If he goes to the restroom in someone else's yard, we make sure that we pick it up and bring it home to throw it in the trash as we want to be a good neighbor. After concluding our walk, we return our leash to its place inside our front door so that we will know where to find it next time.\n",

I will remove the rugs and take them to the deck where I shake them and then hang them to air out. I will scrub the toilet, put the brush back in the toilet brush holder and then I will wipe down the rest of the toilet seat and back of the toilet with pre-moistened cleaning wipes, I let the toilet bowl cleaner sit in the bowl without flushing until someone needs to use the bathroom. I will remove everything that is sitting on the sink and wipe that down with the same wipes, when it dries I will put everything (soap, contact solution, toothpaste) back in order. I will then use Windex to clean the mirrors. I will spray the shower with shower cleaning foam and scrub and rinse that. I then sweep the floor and use a solution of vinegar and hot water to mop the floor.

When the day arrived, I went into their office and checked in at reception. They gave me forms to fill out and asked me to have a seat in the waiting area. I answered questions about any pain or concerns I had about my teeth, and then they called me back. First, the dental assistant asked me questions about how I take care of my teeth, and she checked for cavities by poking each tooth. Next, we took X-rays of my teeth. The dentist came into the room and looked at the X-rays. I had no cavities! After that, the assistant cleaned my teeth with a special treatment and had me rinse it out. She told me not to eat or drink anything for 30 minutes, and I paid for my appointment and left.\n",

When I got to the airport and arrived at the Spirit line to check my luggage, then line was huge and people were scattered all over. I waited for about an hour with my girlfriend before we were finally helped. After getting helped, we went into the line for the security checkpoint. At this time, our ID's were checked and we also had to put everything into the bucket as we went through the metal detector. This part was quicker, but it was still somewhat annoying. Shortly after, we passed this stage and were able to go to the gate where our plane was located. We were there right on time, as the plane was just starting to board.

When I got to the cashier, and got my money and paid for the clothes.  After that, I felt hungry so I decided to find something to eat.  I walked around for a while and found a good restaurant.

Folding clothes makes them easier to store in the closet or in a chest of drawers. If you are going to iron the clothes later, they are less rumpled if you have folded them first. If I have all of my clothes in one laundry basket, I usually sort them first. I put them in piles according to clothing type. The surface of a made bed is a good place to fold clothes. I smooth out my socks and put them in pairs, tucking them together at the tops so they stay together. Underwear, both women's and men's I fold at least in half, sometimes in quarters. First I lay the item on the bed, smooth the fabric so that the item is reasonably flat, then I fold it into one or two parts. Men's boxer shorts can also be rolled into a sort of a tube shape or sausage. This is still folding them, as it minimizes the wrinkles. I fold T-shirt, after smoothing them out, by folding the sleeves in first, then folding the remaining garment in half and then in quarters. Pants I also lay them flat on the bed, smooth them out, then fold into quarters. Pants can also be smoothed then rolled with a minimum of wrinkles when you take them out to wear them. I don't fold a lot of other kinds of clothes, as my husband and I sleep in T-shirts and underwear. After I am done folding the clothes I put them away on a shelf in the closet or in drawers.\n",

I fill the washing machine halfway with the colored and a darker clothes or maybe slightly more, making sure they are evenly distributed so that the load is not unbalanced. I measure out a half a cap full which is the recommended amount for the type of detergent and machine that I have. I pour the detergent into the specified slot. I close the lid and turn the dial to cold water wash and make sure that the settings are proper. I prefer cold water because it's cheaper and doesn't fade colors or make dyes bleed. I also set the soil level to high, spin speed to high, and make sure the clothes are spun out twice so that they dry faster in the dryer. I then press start, the washing process will take about an hour. Once the clothes are clean and spun out I deposit them in to the dryer.\n",

She asked me a few questions and took my temperature and blood pressure. When she was finished, she told me the doctor would be in soon and left the room.

While the coals are getting hot I get the hamburgers, hot dogs, cheese and buns.  Once the coals are red and hot, I put the hamburgers and hotdogs on. They sizzle and pop while they cook.  I roll the hot dogs back and forth with a tong and when the hamburgers are ready I flip them over with a spatula.  I put cheese on the top of them so it can melt.  I also put the buns on the top grill so they can toast.  As soon as the hot dogs and cheeseburgers are done, I put the toasted buns on the plates and put the hot dogs and cheeseburgers on the plates.  I bring them to the picnic table where my family is waiting to put ketchup, mustard, and relish on them.  We also have French fries, cold slaw, macaroni and cheese and salad to go with it.

At home, we organize our clothes into light and dark colored loads, and sometimes we make a separate load of delicate things. We stuff the laundry into pillow cases, and each of us carries one. My mother carries a big container of laundry soap too, although it's possible to buy small packages of soap at the laundromat. Once we get there, we load the light clothes, the dark clothes, and the delicate clothes into separate machines. We set the dials on the front of the machines to Hot for light-colored clothes, Cold for dark-colored clothes, and Delicate for special things that might tear. Then we put quarters in the machines, and they start. In less than an hour they are done, and we load them into the huge dryers.

The place mats were already on the table so I wrapped a napkin around one knife and fork and placed it beside a place mat.  I did this for myself, my brother, and my parents.  Then I went back in the kitchen and got out four plates.  Those I placed in the middle of each of the place mats.  Next I went back to the kitchen and got out four cups and I put ice in each of them.  I put the cups on the other side of the place mat from the knives and forks.

I bought a few bags of chips, cut veggies and dip. I made buffalo chicken dip, hot crab dip and ordered some pizzas. A friend made some desserts to bring along. We had so much food that I made guests take some along home with them. The weather was rather warm for December so we were able to hang out on the deck which was fun that we weren't all cooped up inside.

Then I shook the roots of the tree to loosen them . Then I placed the tree in the hole . I used a shovel to replace the dirt back over the tree roots . Once satisfied the tree was firmly in the ground i dragged over the hose . New trees needs lots of water . I watered the tree until I was satisfied and then put mulch around the base . I also attached ropes to secure the young tree so it would n't fall over while it 's roots were still settling in . I also had a canal funnel installed to make sure water went right into the roots where it was needed most . Once all was said and done I stepped back to admire my handy work . \n",

My taxi was delayed but it pulled up about 15 minutes later and I jumped into the back.  I explained my situation to the taxi driver and he did his best to bring me to the airport as quickly as possible.  We arrived at the airport and I used the machine in the back to pay my fare by credit card.  I retrieved my luggage fro the back of the taxi and I was on time for my flight to Florida.\n",

I picked up the flat sheet first and spread it on top of the mattress. I pulled it all the way up to the top of the mattress, and then folded it down about a foot and a half. I also tucked it in underneath the mattress. Once the sheet was even on both sides and smooth, I spread out my blanket on top of it. I again made sure that it was even on both sides. I also placed the two large pillows on the top of the mattress at the head of the bed. Lastly, I covered the entire bed and pillows with a large handmade quilt that my grandmother made. I topped the quilt with matching decorative pillows placed on top of the large pillows already at the head of the bed.\n",

I took off my clothes and grabbed my favorite rubber ducky from a shelf . I dropped him into the tub . If I needed a bath , so did he . I also poured some bubble bath into the tub as it was filling with water . It foamed up into lots of bubbles . When the tub was full enough , I turned off the water and got into the tub , being careful not to slip on the slippery porcelain . I lay back in the warm water and shut my eyes , relaxing . When the water started to get cold , I stood up and grabbed the towel from the curtain rod . I draped it around myself and then opened the tub 's drain so the water could drain out . I went off to get dressed , and when I was done I went back to the bathroom and turned the shower on for a minute so the bubbles would all go down the drain .

I look at lots of different colors I think I would like, and pick out one that looks good. I think about what type of paint I would like too. Some paints are easy to use, but more expensive. Some paints need an extra coat to help cover the whole wall, and can be more work. I go to the store and pick out a good kind of paint in the color I want. This kind of paint is thick and only needs one coat, so it is easy to use. I come home and lay down blankets in front of the walls I want to paint. The blankets will catch any drops that fall off the brush while I paint, so the floor does not get messy. I dip the brush into the paint and paint the walls, making sure I cover all the white spots. After the walls are covered in the new color, I wait for the paint to dry. Now that the paint is dry, I can touch the walls again and they look nicer.\n",

One of the biggest problems, though, is that they often shed hair. Just this past weekend, one of my dogs shed a lot of hair on the carpet that needed to be vacuumed. Since it's pet hair, though, it takes a few extra steps to clean the carpet. The first thing I did was use a special pet hair brush across the carpet to catch as much loose hair as possible. I put the loose hair into a garbage bag, and threw it away. Then, I plugged in my vacuum and went over the entire carpet. After the first round, I went over the carpet again with the brush just in case there was any hair left behind. Finally, I vacuumed the carpet a second time to clean up as much pet hair, dirt, and trash as possible.\n",

I let the phone ring for a little while thinking about who it could be, and decided to answer it. I went over to the phone and picked it up. I held the phone against my ear and said hello. The person on the other side of the phone said hello also. I did not recognize who the voice belonged to, so I asked who it was.

First, I went to the freezer to see what was inside in terms of meats. When I saw that there weren't any more chicken wings or ground beef, I added them to my list. I also considered the meals that I would want to prepare in the upcoming days, and made a notation of the main ingredients I needed for those entrées that I did not have. I then opened the refrigerator, taking note that there was not any orange juice or milk left, and that the eggs would be empty soon. I completed my list by writing down the vegetables, fruits, beverages and condiments that I saw that were either gone or near empty. Finally, I took note of the vegetables and other canned goods that were in my cabinets, looking to see if I had all of the ingredients needed to make my favorite dishes such as spaghetti, tacos and casseroles. Once I felt my list was complete with all of the necessities, I then filled in the blanks with things that I just simply had a taste for, such as pretzels, popcorn, granola bars and other foods that I were craving for. Now that my shopping list was complete, I read it over for a final time to make sure there was nothing that I was forgetting once I was satisfied with my list, I placed it in my purse so that it will be ready for my trip to the grocery store.\n",

After picking up all of the clothes in the house, we separate the light clothes from the dark clothes. Making various piles of clothes that can fit into the washer and making sure there is enough wash soap we began. Putting the clothes in the washer properly, then its time to measure out the wash soap and fabric softener. The smell of the fabric softener is wonderful. Once the clothes are dried its time to find the iron and ironing board. Turning the iron on to the correct setting I pick up the pair of pants to iron. Making sure that they are turned outwards, the iron presses a steamy crease down the center of the pants.  Have to be careful and not get burned while ironing laundry which can be painful and I have done many times.  The iron light comes on that it needs more water for steaming.

We made sure to dress up nicely, since we were going to be in a public place and didn't want to look badly dressed. One we got there, we did a number of different things. The first thing we did was take my younger brother for a haircut. While he was getting that done, my parents and I went to the food court just across the floor from the barber shop to order some lunch. We saved a plate for my brother for when he was done with his haircut. After he got out and ate, we went around the place and visited different stores. We visited a pet adoption place just to see the dogs that were there. We also visited a sports store, since my brother and dad are big sports fans.

Luckily, the shirt had some extra buttons sewed on the inside.  I carefully cut the thread holding on one of these buttons using a pair of scissors.  I took the button and put it on a sheet of white paper so it would stand out and I wouldn't lose it.  Then I took a needle and thread.  I guided the thread through the eye of the needle.  Once it was through, I put the button against my shirt and went in and out with the needle and thread, alternating which hole I was piercing.  I did this many many times, until I was confident the button would be on snugly.  Then I tied off the thread with a stout knot to keep it in place, and cut away the extra thread.

Dana squeezed and squeezed and squeezed until her glass was full of orange juice. she didn't need to juice anymore oranges. Dana was very happy at what she had done, she felt very accomplished. Dana sat down to her nice breakfast and drank her fresh orange juice. and then she went to Walmart to buy some orange juice because that process was too long and tiring.\n",

After the gruesome trek back to my house I flipped the bicycle upside down and began my repair . First I took off the outer tire to replace my tube with a better more expensive tube that has the ability to fix a puncture . I do not want to experience carrying my bike a mile ever again . After putting the new tube on I screw back on the tire and put the outer tire over the tube . I then fill the PSI to 170 in my tire and listen for any leaking air . Then I spin the tire to make all the slime inside become evenly distributed throughout . This will prevent leaks in the future and even with a slight leak I will still be able to ride back home and fix the tire quickly yet again .\n",

I wander through the crowds until I find a staircase leading down to the underground. I go down the stairs. There are even more people here than there were on the streets above. I find the ticket booth. There are a few people in front of me, so I let them go first. After a few minutes pass, I get my day ticket. Then I look for the line I need to be in. It's easy to find when you follow the signs. Then I wait for the tube. It doesn't take that long to arrive. As soon as the doors open, I'm inside.

Chennai is 800 kms far away from my place and it takes about 15 hours if I drive . I decided to take train . I went online and booked tickets . The economy tickets were sold out so I had to book the expensive one . On the day of the travel , I arrived at the train station almost an hour before the actual departure time . Since it was a first class ticket , I could take more than enough luggage with me . After 15 minutes in to the journey , the ticket collector came by and checked my tickets . It was early in the morning and I was in a window seat . So I could watch all the scenery . Another good thing about the train is that once in a while I could get up and walk a stretch . Also , when I 'm hungry , I could get down at the station and buy any food as the train stops at the station for 10-15 minutes . Overall it was a wonderful experience . \n",

We picked out new cabinets, flooring, counters, and appliances at a few local stores and had them delivered to our house. We redid the floors by removing the existing tiles and laying down hardwood flooring. We repainted the walls a pretty light color and installed the new modern cabinets. We had a professional install the counter tops and appliances. We applied a new tile back splash behind the counters and changed out the sink fixtures to a more modern looking stainless steel. We also put new knobs and handles on the cabinets that matched the stainless steel fixtures. We installed new modern pendant lights. We then changed up the decorations. We loved a french farmhouse style, so we decided to put pretty distressed paintings on the walls and fresh flowers on the counters.\n",

Then we talked about who we wanted to invite. Together we decided on about 30 people we would invite, including friends, family, co-workers and their families.  We got in touch with them via text, phone and Facebook to let them know about the barbecue and see if they would be able to come. A few people had schedule conflicts but most were free and said that they looked forward to having a cook out. A few days before the barbecue we decided on what we would serve. A few of the guests had offered to bring chips, salads and beers but we provided most of the food so we made a shopping list of the items we needed. We bought soda, corn on the cob, burgers, buns, chicken, salmon, and ingredients for salad. The day before the barbecue we prepared the salads so they would be ready ahead of time.

We wanted to paint the walls, so we dropped a drop cloth down to cover the floor.  Once the walls were painted, we then waited for them to dry, and started to put the furniture back.  But this time, the furniture we moved to different spots, to redecorate. We made sure that the table was near the window, so that we could see the sun set in the evenings from there.

When the water was at a good level I shut the water off . I took off all my dirty gym clothes . I then made sure the temperature of the water was nice and warm before I slowly got inside . I soaked in the water for a little while before I grabbed a bar of soap and scrubbed and cleaned my body with it . I also used some shampoo to clean my hair . After dipping into the water to rinse all the shampoo and soap off my body , I unplugged the drain and emptied the water from the tub . I got out and dried myself with a towel .

They told me that they wanted to go on a ski trip at Lake Tahoe. I liked this idea and so did my husband.  After deciding what we wanted to do and at what location, I had to call the ski resort and make reservations for four people.  The operator asked me when we would be coming and if we wanted a special holiday package.  The package includes a 2 bedroom cabin, daily breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  As well as ski rentals and ski lifts to the slopes.  I told the operator that we would be coming in one month from today and that I wanted to buy the holiday package. She took down my name, address, and payment information. I then thanked her for her time and said goodbye.  I told my family that I had made all the reservations for our holiday trip.

I drove to the nearest gas station and pulled up to the gas pump. My gas tank is on the right side of the car so I made sure that it was near the pump.  I pulled the lever that opens up my gas tank door.  I swiped my credit card and selected Regular gas.  I lifted the nozzle and carefully inserted it into my tank.  I squeezed the valve and waited for the tank to fill. After my tank was full I carefully replaced the nozzle and put the cap back on my tank.  I pressed -YES- to receive a receipt of my purchase.

I cleaned and swept my sub floor and laid down a thin layer of padding that goes underneath your flooring. I had a package of wooden floorboards that I bought at a construction store. I opened up the package and took out my long floorboards. These floorboards fit together with each other, just like a puzzle. I started on one side of my room and laid the floorboards together, fitting each new piece to the previous piece I had just put down. Sometimes I had to use my hand or a rubber mallet to bang the floorboards together, because it was such a tight fit. I repeated the process until the entire floor of my room was covered in the new wooden floor.\n",

The nurse led me to an exam room and sat down to take my blood pressure, pulse and temperature. After taking my vitals the nurse told me the doctor would be in to see me in a few minutes. After about 9 minutes the doctor came in and talked with me for awhile listened to my heart and lungs and made some notes about the visit. They asked me what the reason for my visit was, and I told them a routine check up. The doctor asked me about my vision, digestion, and overall health. I told them I was fine and did not notice anything our of the ordinary. The Doctor said my heart sounded good and my lungs were clear.

After that, I picked out a knife that would be good for cutting a lot of vegetables.  I went into the fridge and got out the carrots, peppers, avocado, and lettuce that I would need to cut for the salad.  I placed the lettuce on the cutting board and started to chop it up.  I put the finished pieces in a bowl that we would be taking over to the park.  I used the knife to cut the peppers and the carrots, too.

To do this, first my three kids and I got in our car and drove to our local home improvements shop, and picked out our new wallpaper. It was fun looking at all the different kinds of wallpaper, and after 10 minutes, we picked out our favorite color and design. We also got tools and supplies from the home improvement shop that we would need to apply the wallpaper. We paid for the wall paper and supplies at the checkout counter before we left the store, then we drove home. We chose a bright and happy color, with a self sticking back so that we didn't have to use any messy glue to apply it. First we moved some furniture away from the walls, and cleaned the walls with a wet rag, wiping down any dust. We then applied the wallpaper sheet by sheet, by pulling off the paper backing and pressing the sticky wallpaper onto the wall, making it as neat and straight as possible. It was a long job, and took two days to complete, but we took many breaks in between. We then cleaned up the wallpapering supplies, and left over pieces of wallpaper from some of the strips which we had to cut, and  we vacuumed the room so it would be very clean. We then moved all the furniture back into place. We took a good look at our work, and we really like our bright, and happy and freshly wallpapered room.\n",

We started with the angel hair pasta, since we had several packages of this variety. We started it in a large pot, as we had planned on serving several people this evening. Following the short cooking time, we set the pasta aside to drain. Since we had wanted to spice things up a little beyond the standard pasta dish, we decided that we would add in the pine tree nuts that we had purchased at the local farmers market earlier in the year.

I had to go to the washing machine, put the necessary settings on the washing machine, and wait until it was finish washing. It was a boring wait, but I had to wait so that I could put them in the dryer to of course wait some more. This is the easiest way to do it though, I could have hand washed them and hung them up to dry but I bet that takes even longer. It's a pretty boring chore, but one that is necessary. Who wants to be dressed in dirty clothes after all? Anyways, when I was done doing my laundry I went back to my day, happy to have finished a chore!\n",

I wasn't sure if they were having a medical emergency or if they were intoxicated or texting and not paying attention so I was scared to try to intervene. I flashed my lights at them hoping to get their attention. They were still driving erratically so I carefully called 911. The operator asked my emergency and I explained that the car in front of me was weaving all over the road. The operator asked where I was and I explained the last exit that I passed and the mile marker at that time. I told her I was headed north and still following the car. The operator said that a cop was very close to me and would be there very soon and asked me to stay on the line until I saw the cop. I saw flashing lights in my mirror and slowed down a bit as the cop passed me. The car stopped weaving and began slowing down. I told the operator and asked if I should stop to talk with the cop, the operator told me that it wasn't necessary since the cop was there but asked for my number in case they had any questions as follow up.\n",

If I do not wash them, I don't have anything to cook or eat on.  I washed my dishes last night after I finished with dinner.  I had made spaghetti, so I had several things to clean.  I rinsed out my bowl and lightly scrubbed it with a sponge before putting it in the dishwasher.  I did the same thing with my glass, my utensils, and a plate from lunch that had been left in the sink.  I also had a big pot for pasta, a cutting board where I chopped onions, and a saucepan for making the spaghetti sauce.

We got the eggs out of the fridge and cracked four into a small bowl. We threw away the empty shells and washed our hands. I stirred the eggs with fork to mix them together and scramble them. Once the skillet was hot, my husband poured the egg mixture into it, making sure to move the liquid around with a spatula as it heated. After just a few minutes on low heat, the eggs started to solidify and cook. While he did this, I put our dirty dishes into the sink to be washed later.

Sometimes these things run on batteries and those stop working and you need to change them out. How to do that is to find the back of the clock. This has a little flap with a screw on the back. You get  a screw driver and take the screw out. Once you take that out, you would take the little flappy thing out. There you should see the batteries! You'll take those old batteries out and put the new ones in exactly how the old ones looked like. If you don't, it might not work right. Then you go and put the little flappy thing back in and screw the flappy back in and it should work!\n",

Once we had decided on a date, we made a list of all the supplies we would need. We included tents, sleeping bags and pillows, blankets, lanterns, flashlights, bug spray, food and drinks, games to play, a portable radio, changes of clothes, swimsuits, fishing equipment, and dog food (because we would be bringing one of our friend's dogs with us). We gathered all of the supplies together and stored them in a friend's garage while awaiting the big weekend. In the meantime, we looked online to confirm the campground we were planning on going to was open and had available space. Everything was confirmed and finally the day of departure arrived. We left for the campground early in the morning so that we could have as much time camping as possible.

As I was walking, I noticed a beautiful purple and pink butterfly flitting and flying around my neighbor's flowers in her garden. I approached carefully and quietly, but the butterfly would not stay still. I stood and watched the butterfly, as I took my camera out of the case. I set the settings where I could get details of the butterfly, if it allowed me to get close enough. Finally, the butterfly seemed to get used to my presence and started to fly a little slower. It settled on the petals of a white flower with a pink center. I raised my camera and looked at the screen. I got a little closer and then zoomed the camera a little more. Snap!

I straighten the fitted sheet which fits around the mattress.  Next, I arrange the flat sheet removing all wrinkles and folds, and tuck the loose edges under the mattress.  Next I place the pillow or pillows under the top of the flat sheet.  Next I neatly place the blankets on the bed so they are straight and flat.  With that done, I put the comforter on top of the bed  with the top folded back so the pillows are visible.

While the water heats up I, search for a cover and a matching nipple. I also get the formula can and measuring scoop out of the food cupboard. I add one scoop of formula for every two ounces of water and shake it really well with my finger over the nipple opening. I drip a few drops on my wrist to make sure it's not too hot, or too cold. If it's just right I set it on the table and pick up my son. Holding him so that his head is cradled in the crease of my left elbow I gently touch his upper lip with the nipple so he opens his mouth. I put the nipple in his mouth and support his head. I burp him every ounce or two by resting his head against my shoulder and patting his back firmly but gently.\n",

I decided I wanted to put the painting up in my living room, so I could enjoy it, and it could be seen by anyone who comes to visit me. I measured the painting, then I measured the size of the wall I wanted to put the painting on. Then I measured the area on the wall I wanted to hang the painting on. I put tiny pencil marks on the wall to show me where the painting would be hung. Then I made another small pencil mark to show me where to put a nail in the wall to hang the painting from. I selected a nail and carefully hammered it into the wall. Then I hung the painting on the nail. I adjusted the painting and used a tool called a level to make sure the painting was not crooked on the wall. I'm very happy with how my painting looks on the wall.\n",

It also makes it a very messy entrance. I needed to clean up the toys in the playroom. They key to picking up the toys is that everything needs to have a place. I got several bookshelves. On the bookshelves, I put square bins. Each bin would be to hold a different item. All of the toy cars and trucks go in one, all of the art supplies go in one, all of the lego go in one. I also got an organizer that uses drawers. I put all of the plastic animals, men, and figures in those drawers. I put all of the video games in a bin under the TV.

As the sun was setting, we made sure that we started by collecting the wood together, and putting it on the fireplace outside at the campsite .  We then took some kindling wood, little strips of wood, and put them in between the logs. These would help the logs to burn well.  We also put some paper in between the logs, so that it would catch fire too.  Once we lit the match, we put it to the paper and let it catch fire.  The first papers started to burn bright, and the kindling wood also started to burn.  It caught the logs on fire too. We made a big bonfire, but we were careful to be safe too.  It was beautiful!\n",

Then we started wandering in and out of our favorite stores. Shelley is better at picking out clothes than me. She helps me find things in my size in style while also finding fun things for herself. We both try on clothes and then show them to each other to see if they look good. It's important to have a friend who you trust to tell you if clothes look good on you or not.

I sew a lot, and am very crafty at fixing things, and because of my craftiness he asked me to fix and sew a new button back on his shirt. The other buttons were all white and about half an inch in size, so I dug through a container bin of buttons I had and found a button which was similar in appearance. Once I found the button to replace his missing button, I threaded a needle. I had to use white thread to match the button and it took a while to get the thread through the eye of the needle. Once I got the thread through the eye of the needle, I baste stitched the button onto the shirt where the missing button was before, and sewed through all four of the button holes tightening the button to the shirt.

She seemed to have a fever, so I found the thermometer in the medicine cabinet and checked Belle's temperature. It was 100 degrees, so I called her Dr. Barnes and he told us to come in as early as possible. We went down to the garage and got in the car. We drove to his office on Willow road, and waited there for half an hour. He said that Belle had the flu and prescribed antibiotics, which luckily taste like strawberry. We drove to the pharmacy and pick up the medicine. The pharmacist told us to give two teaspoons on the first day, and then one teaspoon daily for 5 days, even if she felt better earlier than that. Belle sat on the couch as I measured with a syringe to take exactly 5ml, just like the instructions specified, and poured onto a spoon. Belle opened her mouth wide and took the spoon in with the antibiotics and then swallowed it. She liked the taste. I told her she was a good girl and she will start feeling better soon.

This was an easy process and began with me taking bread from the top of the refrigerator and putting it in the toaster oven. I get the process started by turning on the toaster to where it says toast and letting the bread stay in there until the buzzer goes off. In this particular experience, it stayed in the toaster oven for about three minutes before it was ready. Once it was ready, I grabbed the glove for the heat and used it to take out the toast. I then closed the door on the toaster and let the toast sit for a few minutes before eating it. It tasted really good and it was easy to make.\n",

First, take some of the wrapping paper from the roll and place it on a flat surface. You need to make sure you have enough to completely cover your gift! Then, start wrapping the present. Fold the paper over the present's box evenly, to make sure it's covered completely. Some gifts aren't in square boxes, so those can be a little tricky to wrap. Wrap the paper over the top first, then fold the sides to make sure everything is nice and even. Then, you tape the paper shut over the box. Once it's fully taped shut and it's perfectly even, it's wrapped! The only thing that's left to do is put the present under the tree to open on Christmas Day.\n",

When we got to the museum we parked in the Museum's lot.  We walked inside the museum and paid for our admission tickets and for the parking.  We also picked up a museum directory so we could plan which exhibits to visit.  The museum had a movie that was included with the admission price, so we planed to be at the movie theater in the museum before the movie started.  We followed our plan and were able to see the exhibits that were we wanted to see most, and also watched the movie.  At lunch time we went to the cafeteria an bough our lunch.

So first I took off my muddy shoes so that I would not keep getting my floor dirty and started getting ready to clean up the mess. First, I went into my closet and grabbed my broom, dustpan, mop, and bucket. Then I headed over to my kitchen sink and filled my bucket up with hot water and soap. I started by using my broom to collect the chunks of mud and sweep them into my dustpan and empty them into the garbage can. Then I dipped my mop into the bucket of soap and water and mopped up the whole floor until there was no more mud.

I then did some searches on the Internet and read the reviews on each dentists. I chose one that received the best reviews. I called to make an appointment, telling the receptionist that I was currently in pain. The receptionist offered to let me come to the office that day if I was willing to wait for the dentist to fit me in between his existing appointments. I said that I would be willing to do so, and inquired about the cost of a visit and the cost of x-rays and receiving a filling, as I had not yet switched my insurance to my new state. Finding the prices acceptable, I gave the receptionist my name and told her to expect me in about an hour. I arrived at the office and checked in with the receptionist. She asked me to have a seat and she would tell the dentist. I was pleasantly surprised to not have to wait very long. A dental assistant took some x-rays, and before long the dentist came in and told me I had a cavity that needed to be filled. The procedure went quickly and painlessly. I returned to the receptionist who took my payment, which was reasonable. I thanked her and returned home.\n",

I lean my head down into the basin and wet my hair.  My hair is long so I make sure to get all of it into the basin so it gets wet.  Then I get the bottle of shampoo.  I put some shampoo into the palm of my hand and rub it onto my head.  I keep rubbing the shampoo into my hair until it gets sudsy. I am careful not to get the shampoo into my eyes because it might burn.  Once the shampoo has covered my hair, I rinse it out in the basin. I make sure that all the shampoo is out of my hair by rinsing a few times.  This takes a few minutes.  Then I get a towel.  I take my head out of the basin and wrap the towel around my hair so I don't drip water all over the floor.  I rub my head with the towel to dry my hair a little.  Now I am done washing my hair.\n",

We took the oranges home and got the juicer out of the cabinet. We left the peel on the oranges and cut them in half because our juicer is the type that involves pushing the fruit down on the attachment on top of the jar. We took turns with the oranges because we could only do one half at at time. It took about 45 minutes to get the juice out of all the oranges. We transferred the juice into a large pitcher and added some of the pulp left in the orange peels to make the juice thicker and add more orange flavor. We added some ice to the pitcher of juice then put it into the refrigerator. We waited an hour to make sure our juice was chilled then poured two glasses to have a drink.\n",

I place the milk in the pan and turn the heat on low.  I do not want to turn the heat on high, because it will heat the milk too fast and too hot.  When milk is heated too fast and too hot, it will burn it and curdle it, resulting in the milk loosing its creaminess.  I will stir the milk very often in order to keep it from burning and to help it heat evenly.  I will keep stirring this way until the milk starts to boil.  I can tell that the milk is boiling when it starts to form tiny bubbles inside the pan and I can see it boiling.  It looks like a fish is underneath the milk and the bubbles are from it breathing.  Yes, my milk is boiling.  I will give it one final stir and remove it from the heat and proceed with my recipe.\n",

We all had to show our boarding passes at the gate . Once we 'd done that , we were allowed to board a plane . We all walked down a short hallway that connected the airport to the plane itself . As we walked in the door of the plane , a stewardess and a pilot both said hello to us . I walked down the narrow aisle of the plane until I found my seat number , which was near the plane 's right wing . I put the bag I was carrying in an overhead compartment near my seat and sat down next to the window . Soon the plane was taxiing to take off , which means that it was essentially driving to the runway . Once there , the plane got the go ahead to take off . It started going really , really fast , and then suddenly it was off the ground and quickly gaining elevation . I looked out the window and saw the airport and the neighborhood nearby , the streets and cars and fields all get smaller and smaller , until they did n't look real anymore . My flight lasted a few hours . During that time the stewardesses passed around sodas , and people who wanted to eat ordered things like bags of peanuts . I ate a granola bar I 'd taken with me and watched part of a movie that they were showing . Finally it was time to land . The plane started to descend , more and more . Finally its wheels touched the runway . It taxied for a while and then finally came to a stop . People got up and got their bags from the overhead compartments .

I was feeling like the shower was extremely dirty and as a result, I felt the need to clean it. I got out a large amount of cleaning materials and a sponge. I started off by sponging most of the shower and going on my hands and knees. This was tiring and I continued to clean, while spraying cleaner. I then put the bathtub water on and started to scrub more as most of it washed away. I could see the dust and dirt going down the drain as I continued to scrub.

I allowed the fish to soak in the cool water for about thirty minutes, and that gave them the proper time to cool.  After the fish thawed, I patted them dry with a paper towel.  I took about one cup of grated parmesan cheese, and one cup of corn meal and some seasoning salt and mixed them together in a large bowl.  Then I put my fish filets in another bowl and coated them with mayonnaise.  While my fish were in the mayonnaise, I took a very large frying pan filled half way with canola oil.  As the oil was heating I dipped my mayonnaise coated fish fillets in the cheese corn meal mixture until they were thoroughly covered.  The oil heated quickly and I sprinkled a tiny bit of corn meal in the pan to see if it would sizzle.  Since it did, I knew it was time to put my fish in the pan.  I placed 5 fillets in the large pan, and they began to quickly sizzle.  After about seven minutes, the fillets were brown on one side, and I flipped them to continue cooking on the other side.  After another several minutes, the fish were crispy and brown on both sides.  I checked to see if the fish were flaky and done.  They were!  I called my family to dinner and got the tartar sauce.\n",

I couldn't wrap the tie like that, so I bought a small cardboard box.  It was a bit narrow and the perfect size for a tie.  I put the tie in the box and taped it shut.

I took two eggs out of the box and decided to make two fried eggs. But I felt so hungry that I was worried that the two eggs would not be enough. I reached into my pantry and found a can of baked beans. I knew that I had to heat the beans on the stove top before I could eat them though. I took a frying pan and a small sauce pan out of the cupboard. I put both of them on my stove top and turned the gas on low heat. The gas came out and began warming the sauce pan and frying pan. I cracked the two eggs and put them in the frying pan. After some time the gas had heated the eggs, and I knew that they were cooked. I put them on a plate. In the meantime, the gas from the stove top had also heated up the baked beans in the sauce pan. I spooned them onto the plate besides the eggs and ate my delicious breakfast.\n",

After I did this, I picked up all of the big items on the floor and started to vacuum the living room. I moved around slowly, being sure not to miss any areas. While I did this, I went over areas again that did not get completely clean. I listened to the sound of the vacuum and enjoyed the smell of everything getting clean. After finishing, I unplugged the vacuum and put the wire back in the appropriate fashion. I felt good that everything was clean and I put the vacuum back where I got it from. I then tried to use another small vacuum to get smaller areas, such as the stairs.\n",

When I walked in, there was a long line to order because many other people in the area were there on their lunch break. I didn't mind that there was a line because it gave me time to figure out what I wanted to order. I decided to get a Big Mac meal with fries and a Coke. Once I ordered, paid, and picked up my food, I looked around for a table to sit at and eat my lunch. Even though the restaurant was crowded, there were a few tables open by the window. I was lucky because this is my favorite spot to sit. Once I sat down, I opened my bag of food and set up my Big Mac and fries in front of me. I then ate my lunch. It was delicious.\n",

I scooped about 3 tablespoons of coffee into my coffee maker, added a pot of water, and set it to brew. Next, while the coffee was brewing, I opened another cabinet and grabbed a medium sized frying pan. I put it on the stove top, set it to medium high heat, and let it get hot. Once hot I opened my fridge, pulled out my bacon, and set three pieces in the pan. The bacon took a few minutes to start sizzling. After about five minutes, I flipped the bacon over with some tongs. The bacon finished cooking in another five minutes Once the bacon was cooked, I grabbed a plate out of my cabinet and set the bacon down on it with the tongs.

I put gas in the mower and then pulled it out of the shed.  To start the mower, I pulled on the cord.  I pulled the cord once, twice and then on the third pull the mower started and I was able to begin to mow the lawn.  I went back and forth across the lawn in rows.  Down one row, turn, back up the next row.  I did this many times.  Once, there was a tree in the way and I had to go around it, but usually it was down one row, turn, and back up the next row.

I didn't realize how easily linen pants wrinkled, and without ironing, they look as if I'm wearing a sack of potatoes. I went down to the basement to dig out my iron and ironing board, I had to rifle through quite a few boxes in order to find the one I had stashed it inside. After I found it, I brought it back upstairs, set up the ironing board, plugged in, and turned on the iron. I propped it up on the ironing board to let it heat up, and got my pants ready. I tried to remember how to iron, and started with the back of one pants leg, repeated with the other, then ironed the front of the pants.

Then, I sorted the laundry into several piles: whites, darks, colors, delicates and towels.  I started the washer up and added the laundry detergent and fabric softener.  Then, I added my first load of laundry.  While the laundry was in the washer, I tended to other household chores.  When the washing machine buzzed, I knew it was time to take the clothes out.  I took the clothes and put them in the dryer with a dryer sheet.  I turned the dryer on and then started another load in the washer.  When the dryer was finished, I emptied the lint trap and took the clothing out and folding it and put it away in my closet and in my dresser.

We do this because we like each other and want to see each other and talk about what is happening in each other's lives. When we visit, we might just see each other for a few hours, or we might spend a whole week together. We might meet at someone's house or we might plan to meet somewhere, like the beach. We will spend a lot of time talking, but we will probably do a lot of other activities together, like going out for dinner or having a meal at home, or doing special activities together like going on a vacation or going to a play or concert.

It was too expensive for the five of us to fly, so we planned a three-day road trip instead.  We planned for three days of driving each way, with fun things to do on the way to and from our destination.  The first night, after ten hours of driving, we will be camping on the banks of the Mississippi River.  We have a reserved campsite there.  The second night, after driving across Iowa and Nebraska, we will be staying in a motel room.  The third night, we will be with my extended family in Utah.  We have a time-share condo on a mountain reservoir where we plan to stay for a whole week.  We will be hiking, biking, canoeing, playing board games, playing card games, and playing dice games.  I hope to have a lot of fun with my extended family that week.  On the way back to West Virginia, we plan to stop at Zion National Park to hike the legendary Angels' Landing trail.  We also plan to stop at Mesa Verde National Park, Carlsbad National Park, and the Jefferson National Expansion Monument.  We plan to ride the tram to the top of the Gateway Arch there.

After I wrote my letter, I folded it and slid it into the envelope. I licked the sticky strip on the flap of the envelope and pressed it down to seal the envelope. Then I wrote my name and address on the upper left corner. After consulting my address book, I wrote my aunt's name and address very neatly in the center of the envelope. I checked the addresses again to make sure they were neat and correct, and then I affixed the stamp to the upper right corner of the envelope. I picked up the letter and walked out to the mailbox.

He knew his new baby brother was coming home today. His eyes were large as he looked over his brother, obviously not expecting him to be so small. When the baby started crying, Tom became very worried until I explained that his little brother was only hungry. Tom handed me his peanut butter sandwich to share with his new brother. I explained that the baby couldn't yet eat a sandwich and would only drink milk. Then Tom offered his glass of milk for the baby. I had to explain to Tom that small babies drink their milk from a bottle of warm milk. I asked Tom if he would like to help me warm the milk for the baby. His eyes lit up as he quickly nodded yes. We went into the kitchen, and I asked Tom if he could get a bottle of milk from the refrigerator. I explained to Tom that we had to warm the milk but make sure the milk wasn't too hot or too cold. We checked the milk, and it was just right to feed to the baby.\n",

I live by myself and wasn't expecting anyone, so I wasn't sure who would be at the door. I hoped it wasn't someone campaigning for some cause or missionaries or anyone else who expected something from me. I paused the television, stood up, and looked through the peep hole in my door. I saw a man standing outside with a package in his hand. I was relieved to know it was just the UPS driver with a package for me. I unlocked the door and opened it, greeting the man standing outside. He asked me for my name, which I gave him. He handed me the package, wished me a good day, and then returned to his truck.

When we went there, we brought some bread along with us that we could go and give to the fish that were just swimming around.  I took a piece of bread out of the plastic and started to break it up with my hands.  I threw the pieces in the pond, even though I would have liked to eat them.  The bread would settle on the surface of the water and the fish would swim up to go and eat the little pieces of bread.

I sat the box in the middle of the piece of wrapping paper and folded up the two sides to meet, I put down a piece of tape.

Then, she carries the basket to the laundry room. Inside the laundry room, there is a washing machine that my mom calls the Washer. There is also a drying machine that she calls the Dryer. My mom looks through the pile of dirty clothes and picks out the clothes that are all white.  She puts all of the white clothes in one pile, separate from the colorful dirty clothes. For the first load of laundry, my mom always puts in the colorful clothes. She says this is so the bleach she uses when she washes the white clothes does not fade the colorful clothes. Once the colorful clothes are in the washer, she takes out the laundry detergent. She measures out the exact amount on the box and dumps it in. Then, she turns the machine on and the clothes become soapy and spin around until they are clean.  When the washing cycle is done for the colorful clothes, my mom puts the damp clothes into the dryer, sets the timer, and shuts the door.

I rose from the couch and walked over to the door.  I looked out of the window before opening the door because I was not expecting anybody.  I saw a young man probably in his early twenties.  I apprehensively opened the door and the young man was very friendly.  He said that his car had broken down around the corner and unfortunately his cell phone was out of power and he needed to call for help.  I decided to help him out but of course I did not invite him into the house.  I grabbed my cell phone and stepped outside.

I jumped in the car, buckled up and went to the centre. There were so many stores. I took my time walking around and looking at all the things. I found a dress I liked. I asked the employee if he could let me in the dressing room. He did and I tried it on. It was a little too big so I got a smaller size. After paying, I left that store and went looking for shoes to match. I found a cute pair of wedges that fit and bought them. Then, I stopped to grab a bite to eat before loading all of my purchases into the car. I got in my car and went back home to put the stuff away.\n",

I coated it with a little bit of butter so nothing would stick to the pan, and cracked three eggs into the pan. I stirred them up and added some cheese, salt, and pepper to make scrambled eggs. I let them cook for about five minutes before using a spatula to slide them onto a plate. I then put a few strips of bacon in the pan and fried it until it was a little crispy. I put a teabag in a cup, and boiled some water in the kettle. Then I poured the water into the cup to make tea. Once everything was done, I took my scrambled eggs, bacon, and tea to the kitchen table to sit down and eat breakfast. It was delicious!\n",

The party guests all agreed to bring some food or drink which was a big help.  As the guests arrived we set up all of the food and drinks in our kitchen and the party began.  One of my friends is a great disc jockey so he was able to play some fantastic music for the party.  Everybody seemed to be having a great time, most importantly my room mate.

On the day of my brother's wedding, I put on a nice dress and went to the church, where the wedding was happening. The organist played the song \"here comes the bride\", and my brother's fiancee walked in wearing a beautiful white dress. My brother and his fiancee said their vows, which included a lot of the words \"I do\". After that, they kissed and she was now his wife. We then went to a large banquet hall where the reception was being held. They served us a big dinner, followed by the wedding cake. The wedding cake had many layers and lots of icing.

Grabbing the shovel, hoe, and rake she walked towards the back part of the yard that was covered in weeds.  \"Give me 3 weeks and ill have you full of blossoming tomato plants!\" said Monica to the square patch of land in front of her.  \"Most people don't know that the important part of gardening is preparing the soil for the plants!\"  Over the next 3 hours Monica tirelessly worked to clear the square space of the extra plants and roots and mixed up the soil and laid seeds.

I already have a coffee machine that makes espresso - the dark black coffee - and also steams and froths milk, which is a separate attachment.  To prepare for making my coffee, I fill a coffee cup half full of milk. Then I take whole beans and grind them in the grinder, which is very quick.  I usually grind two grinders full of beans at once and keep the ground coffee in an airtight container, so I don't have to grind it every time.  I take a couple tablespoons of the grinds and put them in the basket that then is inserted into the coffee maker. Next I turn on the coffee maker and when it indicates it's ready, place the mug of milk under the attachment and let it froth the milk until it is hot - usually one or two minutes.  Finally, I press the button to have hot water run through the coffee grinds, running the coffee into the mug of frothed milk then turn off the coffee machine and enjoy.\n",

It did, so I took the filter to the sink to wash out the old grounds. Once the filter was clean, I took out a bag of fresh coffee grounds and put two scoops of them into the clean filter. Then I put the filter back into the coffee maker. Next, I took the empty coffee pot from the coffee maker and went back to the sink. I filled the coffee pot up with water until it was at the 8-cups line. I poured all the water in the coffee pot into a shaft in the coffee maker. Then I put the empty coffee pot back into the coffee maker. Everything was in position now. The filter contained fresh coffee grounds, the coffee maker had 8 cups of water in it, and the coffee pot was empty and ready to be filled with coffee. The only thing left to do was press the on button. After I did that, the coffee began to brew.\n",

After that I carefully folded it up and placed it inside an envelope. I had to look up his address because I did not remember it and I wanted to be sure it was accurate. After that I sealed the letter and wrote my return address on the letter. Then I took the envelope containing the letter to the post office. I had to wait in line a while before I was served by the clerk. The clerk took my letter and weighed it on the scale. It was heavier than a normal letter so I had to pay extra postage.

These sheet suspender things hook to the corners of the fitted sheets and through tension, keep the sheet from slipping off the corners of the mattress. I put the fitted sheet on and attached the suspenders, it seemed to work well. I then sprinkled some baby powder on the fitted sheet because I like the way it smells and feels in the bed. I spread the flat sheet out on top of that and then the comforter as well. I put two pillows back in their shams and the other two back in their cases. I sprayed lavender and jasmine pillow spray on the pillows and tucked all the edges in.

I bought big bag which has at least 10 oranges in them.  I have juicer which squeezes juice perfectly. First, I peeled all oranges. Then I cut them in 4 pieces each. I opened juicer and opened the top. There is little opener in juicer, where you can keep putting the oranges without stopping your mixture.  I set up a big container for juice under the juicer, where it pours from juicer. I turned o switch, and kept putting orange slices one by one. It squeezed the juice and pulp left behind over the blade. After a while, I switched off, because there was so much pulp collected. I cleaned it out and again repeated the same process again until all oranges finished.  It made big jug full of juice. Fresh and clean. Ready to be served.\n",

Some people have lawn mowers you can sit on and ride, mine is a push mower since my lawn isn't very big, and I like the exercise. I checked to make sure there was enough gas in the mower, and pulled the string to start the engine. Being careful, since the mower has very sharp, fast-moving blades underneath, I went in a straight line from one end of the yard to the other. I kept doing that until my yard was completely mowed and all the grass was cut short. After I finished mowing the lawn, I made sure to put my lawn mower back in the shed where it belonged, and enjoyed a large, cold glass of lemonade, since lawn mowing is hard work.\n",

I am picky about the temperature so it takes me a few minutes to make sure that the water is perfect.  I then enter the shower and start scrubbing my whole body.  I use a body wash that I really like and make sure that my body is really clean. Once my body is clean I wash my hair with my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  I often let the conditioner sit in my hair for a few minutes so that my hair is easier to manage when I get out of the shower.  After I rinse out the conditioner I get out of the shower and dry myself with a really large fluffy cotton towel.  After my shower I am ready to start my day.\n",

The first thing I normally do every morning after getting out of bed is make my bed.  I wake up, get out of bed and immediately start running my hand across my bed in order to straighten the wrinkles out of my bottom, fitted sheet.  When I wake up on time, unlike today, I then pull up my top, flat sheet and straighten my pillows.  Some people tuck their top sheet in under the mattress and tuck it about their pillows when they make their bed.  I don't; I simply pull the top sheet and then the blanket over my pillows and let the sides and bottom of the top sheet hang free.  I don't like feeling all packed into my bed as if it was a sleeping bag.  Well, tonight that certainly won't be an issue since I didn't make my bed at all!\n",

I then realized he had a dirty diaper and needed a diaper change. I never leave him in a diaper that is not clean and dry, so I immediately went and got his diaper bag. He laid back on the carpet. I picked up his little legs and put the changing pad under him. I pulled off his shorts, unsnapped the diaper and removed it. I removed the diaper, closed it with the Velcro into a ball and threw it in a garbage bag. I then warmed up a baby wipe by rolling it in between my hands. I cleaned him with the baby wipe. I threw the wipe into the garbage bag. I put a clean diaper on him and he started singing his songs, asking for his truck.

I got a pot out of the pantry, filled it with cold water, then placed it on top of the eye on the stove. Then I turned the knob that controls the heat on the I and set the temperature to high so that the water will boil. I waited about five minutes into the water began boiling, which is when I took the spaghetti noodles out of the box and immerse them in the boiling water. I added a dash of salt to the water to keep the noodles from sticking to each other, then with a wooden spoon, I began to gently stir the water, salt and noodles after two minutes of cooking, I repositioned the noodles so that the parts that had not been submerged underwater could begin to boil in the water. Once all the noodles were submerged underwater, then I begin to stir the noodles in the water every 30 seconds in order to keep them from sticking to the bottom of the pot. I watched as the noodles turned from yellow and hard to soft and pale in color. As the noodles became more soft, they began to bend and curve, which is when I reduced the heat from high to medium in order to prevent over cooking the noodles. After about eight minutes of cooking, I checked the noodle to see if it was hard or soft. Once I saw that the noodles were soft enough to be pinched easily, I turned the heat completely off, remove the sauce pot from the heat's, and drain the water from the noodles by emptying the entire pot into a strainer that is situated inside the sink. After I emptied the pots, and the water drained out of the strain, all that is left is the noodles, which are ready to be used in a pasta dish such as spaghetti.\n",

I went to the hall closet where the vacuum is stored and took out the vacuum cleaner.  I plugged it in.  Then, I moved furniture out of the way and picked up any large pieces of lint or debris.  After that, I turned on the vacuum and swept it over the carpets.  I lifted the tables and got every crack and corner of the room.  Next, I went to the stairs and unhooked the attachment to the vacuum cleaner that is used for cleaning the stairs.  I went up each of the stairs, carefully sucking up all of the dirt that gathered over the weekend.  When I was finished, I wound the cord back up and put the vacuum back into the hall closet.

I found items that I thought would be perfect so I read reviews of people who had bought them before to see if they were good products or not. After I decided on several things I wanted and added them to my cart, I realized if I added a couple dollars more I would get free shipping so I added some treats for my dogs. I searched google to see if there were any coupon codes for this store and found one that said it would work. I entered the coupon code and it did work so I got an additional 10% discount. I entered my shipping address and credit card information and double checked everything in my cart to make sure it was the items and sizes I wanted.

I went online and bought gifts for all of my family members, but of course, I wasn't going to just put the gifts under the Christmas tree just like that. I went out and bought some of the nicest looking wrapping paper I could find, along with some tape, bows, name tags, and scissors. Next, I put whichever gifts that weren't already in boxes into some boxes, and I closed them up with tape. The next step was the wrapping. I needed to roll out the right amount of wrapping paper to fit around the box completely, and cut it loose from the rest of the roll. Then, I needed to fold the corners so there was no loose paper sticking out, and tape the wrapping paper closed. After the boxes were completely wrapped, I put on a name tag for whoever the gift was for, and a bow to top it all off.\n",

After collecting the laundry and putting it all in the dirty clothes hamper, I carried it to the laundry room. In the laundry room I sorted the clothes into different piles, darks, whites, towels, and delicates. The first load I needed to wash was the dark clothes. I picked the clothes up and placed them in the washer. Then I closed the door. After I heard the latch on the washer door click, I turned on the washing machine. I turned the dial to the \"normal\" setting\" and added the appropriate amount of washing detergent. I also wanted the clothes to be soft, so I added some fabric softener to the wash.

I first looked inside the dust filter to make sure that it was not full. The filter was full, so I pulled it out and emptied it into the trash can so there would be room in the filter. I replaced the filter and found an outlet to plug in my vacuum. I turned the vacuum on and began to run it over the carpet. I did it in a series of long, parallel strokes so that my carpet would not have any weird patters in it. I made sure to lift up our chairs and had my boyfriend help me by lifting up the couch so I could get underneath. Once the room was vacuumed, I double checked that I hadn't missed anything and I unplugged the vacuum. I replaced the cord on the vacuum and put it back in the closet where I got it out from.\n",

I will fill up the coffee pot and fell the maker. Then I will put coffee grounds and a filter in to the coffee maker and hit the on switch. My son usually only wants cereal so I'll get out a bowl for him and put his cereal and some milk next to his place at the table because he likes to pour it himself. Then I'll make scrambled eggs for everyone else. I'll crack an egg into a bowl and stir them up with a fork. Then I'll put on a pan and smear some butter in it while it heats up on the stove. I'll put toast in the toaster while that warms up but not for long and then I'll pour the eggs into it. I keep an eye on the eggs and stir them with a fork. They are done quickly, as is the toast.

I still always did it, though. Otherwise, I knew I would get in trouble with my parents. The first thing I did was tie up the bag. I would grab two ends of the bag, and tie them into a knot to make sure the bag wouldn't open. Then, I'd take the garbage outside and throw it into the dumpster. Next, I'd go back inside and put new bags in each trash bin inside the house. I'd take a new bag from a roll that we had in the kitchen or bathroom, depending on which trash bag I was replacing, and put it inside the trash bin. To make sure that the bag wouldn't fall in, I would wrap the edges of it around the top of the trash bin and, if possible, tie a small know to secure it.\n",

We decided to start by replacing the worn flooring in our living room first.  First, we tore up the old, stained carpeting.  Then we went to Home Depot to look at flooring samples.  I wanted to put in hardwood floors but my husband wanted carpet.  We finally agreed on buying hardwood floors for the living room.  We bought the flooring and the supplies and took them home.  Next, we laid down the materials the go underneath the boards.  Next, we carefully laid the boards and made sure they were placed just right before securing them.

I considered every wall until I decided on the living room. It was the best place to put it because it would match the other paintings. I took a measuring tape and a pencil and measured where I wanted it on the wall. I made sure it was equal lengths from the other paintings on each side. I made a mark with my pencil where the nail should go. I grabbed my toolbox and pulled out my hammer and a nail. I placed the nail on the pencil mark and hammered it in half way.

I took the old sheets off, removed the pillow cases from my pillows, and tossed them into a pile on the floor of my bedroom before going to the hallway closet and taking out a fresh, clean set of sheets. I unfolded the fitted sheet first and started in one corner of the mattress, getting that corner in place before stretching the sheet slowly to slip over the next corner, then the next, and then the fourth and final corner. Then I unfolded the top sheet and centered it on the bed. I tucked the bottom end in under the mattress, making sure that I still had enough on the bed to use at night. Then I slipped clean pillowcases onto my pillows. I pulled the top sheet tight and straightened it out over the bed before setting the blanket on top. I was done!\n",

It is always an adventure when you are riding your mountain bike through the great outdoors . One particular issue that affects all mountain bikers , is flat tires . I have had numerous flat tires during my years riding . The first flat tire I ever had left me stranded miles away form civilization . I had to hoof it out on foot , carrying a broken bike . It was an experience I did not want to relive again . From then on I purchased and kept many bicycle tire tubes in my riding gear . To replace a bicycle tire is now a simple process for me . You break the bead on the old tire shell and pull it slightly to the side . You work the tube out from between the rim and the tire itself . You then stuff the new rubber tube where the old one was , making sure the nipple matches with the nipple hole . You then move the outer tire back into position and pump up the tire . \n",

I grabbed two bulbs from the supply closet and then  I dragged a kitchen chair into the bathroom because the step stool was not tall enough for the vaulted ceiling. I propped the door open with a shoe so that some light could get in from the opposing window in the hallway. I stepped up onto the chair and began to unscrew the glass enclosure exposing the blown bulb. I gently set the glass covering at my feet on the chair. I reached up and began unscrewing the bulb. I tossed the dead bulb into the bathroom trash can. I grabbed one light bulb that I set on the bathroom counter and screwed it in, I did the same with the other bulb so complete darkness in the bathroom wouldn't happen again. I then screwed the enclosure back on and put the chair back in the kitchen.\n",

I took it into my garage and tried to repair it by putting some duct tape on it and pumping it with air . This , however , only made matters worst and all the air ended up making another hole in my tire because I over inflated it . I decided that I had no other options and I ordered a new tire on Amazon for my bike . Once that came in the mail it was time to repair my broken bike . I got a socket wrench and unscrewed the nut of the bike that attached to the wheel . After that I got my new bike tire and put it on the frame of the bike and screwed it back on .

I thought about what I usually have in the fridge and what I liked to eat. I started by writing down the snacks I wanted, since I usually buy snacks when I go out. I checked how much of each food I had left in the cabinet and wrote down things that were almost out. I thought about what was in the freezer. There was not much inside the freezer it looked like, so I wrote down some frozen foods like chicken nuggets. After a while, I had a long list of things that I wanted to buy.

The room was full of people in fancy dresses and tuxedos who were dancing to swing music, our favorite type of music to dance to. There was a live band on a stage at the very back of the restaurant. We found a table to sit at and have a glass of wine before getting out on the dance floor. Once we were finally ready to go, we got on the dance floor just as one of our favorite swing songs was being played by the band. We danced for three hours but it didn't even feel that long because we were having such a good time. Finally, my husband and I decided to leave the restaurant once we were tired.

I put in six or seven eggs, a cup of flour, and a cup of milk to make sure it stayed runny.  When I mixed them with a fork, I made sure that all the of the ingredients were mixed together.

As a result, I first cleared everything off of the table and found a clean spot for it. I then cleaned the table and put place settings on it. I received help from my  girlfriend, who brought me the utensils as I placed them on the table. This was an easy experience and I felt like I was able to achieve my goal relatively quickly. Soon after, the table had a placemat, as well as everything that we needed on the dinner table. Everything was clean and looked orderly.

I have vinyl floor so I am going to clean it first with a vacuum to get crumbs and other things off it.  Then I get a bucket with hot water and an antibacterial cleaner made for floors.  I also have a squeegee brush with a rectangular yellow sponge.  I put the brush in the water and them squeeze almost all the water out of the sponge.  I then move the sponge back and forth across the floor.  I often dip the sponge back in the water and squeeze it out again.  Dirt is being picked up by the sponge and I dip the sponge to wash the dirt off and get clean water on it.  With time, though, the clean water is getting dirty from dipping the dirty sponge in.  I keep going over the floor until all the floor has been wiped with the sponge.  If the floor is very large I may need to refill the bucket with clean water and cleaner again.  I am careful not to step on any floor that is wet from being cleaned.  I then give the floor time to dry before standing on it.\n",

It is something I do not do often, since email makes everything so much more convenient, and also I live in a suburban neighborhood with only a mail slot, where in order to mail a letter I have to go to a post office or find a mail box. Since this Sunday is father's day I decided to do something nice for my dad, and get him a card, with a gift card to a bookstore and a handwritten letter inside for a father's day gift. I think he will like the handwritten letter the best, because it is something I do not do often, and I told him how much he means to me and thanked him for all he did raising me. As a child, my mom was stay-at-home, so I usually spent time with her and was closer to her than I was my dad. As I've gotten older, my dad and I have bonded over similar hobbies and interests, so by taking the letter, stamping it, and dropping it off at the local post office, I've kept an old tradition alive, and hopefully given him a father's day gift he will love.\n",

When I get there I park and go inside. I like walking down the rows. Each row is marked for what kind of movies are in that row like: comedy, drama, horror, classics, Christian, new releases and documentary. Some times there are rows of music videos and other topics. Sometimes I pick more than one movie. I pick more movies if it is a holiday or long weekend that gives me plenty of time to watch the movies. Next I need to pay the rental fee. I go to the counter.

All of a sudden the toaster pops the toast up. It is done! It is hot. I got my tongs and pulled the toast out and put jelly on one toast. I put peanut butter on the other toast.

I had to call several weeks in advance to schedule the appointment, since it was my first time seeing this doctor they asked me print out new patient paperwork and bring along medical records if I had any. I arrived to the appointment early to complete paperwork. I was called back and a physicians assistant asked me questions about the purpose of the appointment and if I had any history with skin cancer, I told her I did not and was just there for a check to make sure everything was OK. She asked if I minded if the doctor brought in a med student who was working with her, I told her it was fine. She gave me a paper gown to change into and told me to remove everything including socks. The doctor, med student and physicians assistant all came in and the doctor checked over my entire body, commenting about freckles but saying everything looked OK. She said everything looked good and recommended a check once a year since I am very pale and have a family history of skin cancer.\n",

I normally go to a place that calls for a phone call in advance of arriving but this time I decided to go to a different place where I could just walk in . When I arrived I had to wait for about 10 minutes before someone could cut my hair , which was alright with me since I did not make an appointment or anything . When I got in the chair the lady cutting my hair asked me what kind of haircut I wanted and I told her short hair on the top with a buzz cut on the sides . She told me that would be a great look for me and I agreed . During the hair cut I talked to the barber about what I did in life and asked her some questions as well . After about 10 minutes she finished the job . I tipped her 5 dollars for her effort and went off satisfied with my haircut . It was a good experience . \n",

I can pay to have the postal service take my letter and give it to my friend for me, which is much easier. I write my letter and find an envelope to fit the letter in. I put the letter inside the envelope and lick the sticky side of the flap. I press down the sticky part of the flap against the envelope to make sure my letter stays safe inside. On the front of the envelope, I write where my friend lives in the center, and where I live in the top left corner. I put a stamp on the top right corner, which shows the postal service that I have paid them. I then drive to the post office and drop the stamped letter into a box where all the letters are picked up and delivered. After a few days, my friend gets my letter from a mailman.\n",

A week ago I had boiled several different kinds of fruits and vegetables until they were soft. I then poured portions of each fruit or vegetable into ice cube trays and froze them. Now, I pulled out the trays and picked which foods I wanted. A cube of sweet potato was the first choice; next a star shaped cube of squash. Lastly, another star shaped cube of applesauce and a few spoonfuls of rice cereal. I put it in the microwave and then mixed it all together. I put my baby in the high chair and tied a bib around his neck. He likes to eat so as soon as he saw the spoonful, he opened his mouth wide. He swallowed the bite and I scooped up the small bits that had dribbled down his chin. I fed him bites until he had finished off the portion. I gave him a bottle of water while I washed up his tray and cup.\n",

On the day of the appointment, I drove to my doctor's office. I walked in, checked in with the receptionist at the front, confirmed my insurance information, and waited for my name to be called. When a nurse called my name, I followed her to the back of the office where she took my height and weight measurements. After we did this, we went into the examination room where she took my temperature and blood pressure. The nurse then left, and I waited for the doctor to come in. When the doctor came in, she listened to my lungs, examined my throat, nose, and ears, and pressed on the sides of my jaw to check my glands. She asked about any changes in my life and I informed her that nothing had changed in the past year. She said to keep eating healthy and exercising at least three times a week.

I place them on the counter, far back so they will not roll off.  I find a small pan with a handle and fill it half way with cold water. Then I carefully pick up one egg and place it gently in the pan of water. Did I forget the other egg? No, I pick it up next and again put it carefully in the pan of water. Does the water cover both eggs? Not quite, so I add a little more water until both eggs are covered with water. I have a gas stove.  I want to turn on the left front small burner.  I know that the left knob on the front of my stove controls the left front small burner. So I turn the left knob until it clicks. Then the gas flame lights and is providing heat for me to cook the eggs. Next I pick up the pan of water with two eggs in it. I place the pan on the left front burner. Now I must watch the pan of water and eggs. I know the water must get hot to boil the eggs. In fact the water must boil with bubbles. Soon  the flame under the pan makes the water hot. When the water boils, then I watch the clock on the stove for 3 minutes.  After 3 minutes I turn the left knob on the front of the stove to \"off\" and the flame goes away. Now I let the water cool so I will not burn myself with the hot water. After about 15 minutes I take a spoon and remove the boiled eggs from the water.  I put them in a small bowl.  They are still in their shells. I decide to put the two boiled eggs back in the refrigerator to get them cold for my lunch.  I will eat them when I am hungry. So now you know how I make two hardboiled eggs using my kitchen gas stove.\n",

Everywhere we went, Molly found something she wanted to chew on. So a short walk turned into hours.  Then she was thirsty, so I gave her some water that I brought with me. Finally I told her it was time to run home. Once we got home I saw the newspaper had arrived, so I called to Molly to go get it. I took off her leash and she ran to the front door to get it.

I checked the level of gasoline in the engine and decided I had enough to complete the job.  I wheeled the mower over to the middle of my yard and Pushed the start button.. The mower started and I began to walk the the mower back and forth across my lawn up and down forming neat slightly overlapping rows.  The smell of fresh cut grass was nice.

I only live 6 blocks from my parents, so my son and I generally walk or ride our bikes over to the house. My son calls this day \"cousin day\" because he gets to see all his cousins. My 5 brothers, my sister, all of their spouses and children congregate at the house. The adults usually cook some food and talk around the kitchen table. The kids run all around the house, playing and dressing up in costumes. Then, they go outside and swing on the swings and ride on the bikes in the backyard. We all sit down for a lunch and talk until we are full. We then spend some time cleaning up the house before we all go home, needing to prepare for the upcoming week.

I made sure the settings on the toaster were like I wanted them.  I didn't want my toast to be too dark.  While I waited for the toast to cook, I poured myself a glass of juice and took the butter out of the fridge.  Soon enough, the toast popped up out of the toaster.  It was done.

It wasn't close enough to photograph with my phone camera, so I pulled out my DSLR camera with a zoom lens. The eagle was perched on a tree branch, I think it was some kind of pine tree. I zoomed in and got into position to take the photo. I made a little whistle sound, to get the eagle to look in my direction. He looked right at me and I snapped the photo. The sound of my shutter must have spooked him, because he flew away right as I took the shot. That was the first time I've ever seen a bald eagle in the wild, and I was able to get an awesome photo of it. I was so happy that I ran right home and shared the picture on social media.\n",

When the doorbell rings and I do not know who is at the door, I can feel a little nervous or scared. Still, I got up to go answer the door and see who was there. When I opened the door, I saw that it was the postman who rang the doorbell. I said hello. The postman answered, \"Hello, I have a package for you. Please sign here.\" I signed my signature on his tablet and then took the package and said, \"Thank you very much.\" I closed the door and brought the package inside my house.

After that I went to the bathroom and got the medicine out of the cabinet. I read the label and made sure it was safe for her to take. I then looked to see how much she could take and how often. I took out the correct number of pills and went to the kitchen to get her a glass of water. I brought the pills and water to her and she put the pills in her  mouth and then took large drinks of water until she swallowed the pills. I made sure the cap was put back on the pill bottle and I returned the bottle to the top shelf in the cabinet.

This is so the different colors don't run and stain my clothes while they're being washed. I put one pile into the washing machine. I put laundry detergent and fabric softener into the drawer in the front of the washing machine. It has separate places where each ones goes. They help clean the clothes and make them soft. I close the washing machine and choose the right setting by turning the dial. The washing machine starts to wash the clothes by filling with water and spinning them around. When the washing machine is done it drains the water and beeps to tell me to take out the clothes. I then put the clothes in the dryer. I put a dryer sheet in with the wet clothes to make them smell nice and stop them getting stacticky and sticking together. I choose the right setting on the dryer dial, and it dries the clothes by spinning them around and blowing hot air on them. When the dryer is done it beeps for me to talk the clothes out. I then fold them and put them away.\n",

Usually depending on what time of day I go, I can find a quiet spot by a tree or by some flowers so I have a nice background.  Once I find a good spot I set my camera up on a small tripod.  I put my dogs where I want them to sit and focus on them through the view finder.  When I have a nicely framed shot I press the capture button and take the picture.  I will check the image on the digital camera's screen and make sure its a nice photo.  If its not I will delete it and try again.  Once I get a few nice shots of my dogs I will set a timer for 10 seconds and go sit with them.  When I hear the camera click, I know the picture was taken and I go check it.

We make sure to wake up really early to get on the road to avoid the traffic that we are sure to hit on a trip to the beach on a hot summer's day. We pack a cooler of sandwiches, waters, and fruit to enjoy while we are there. We also pack some toys for the kids like pails, shovels, and sandcastle molds. We also are sure to pack towels, a big umbrella, and a blanket. When we get there, we are sure to lather up with sunscreen, making sure not to miss a spot. It is so easy to get sunburn when you're out playing on the sand all day. We also lay out our towels and blankets. When we are done with all of that, we take a swim in the ocean. We play games where we try to dive down before waves hit. Another fun thing that we do is ride the waves on our boogie boards. With so many fun things to do at the beach, it is no wonder that we are exhausted by the time we leave at the end of the day.\n",

So many results came up, and I was able to sort by good reviews, and if they have Prime shipping. This limited the search to a few good items, and I clicked on one with arm bands and a picture of a shark on it. Alex likes sharks, and just began making shark noises, which involving him making a chomping sound.

I always make sure to have my metrocard in my wallet, so if I ever need the subway I can always get on it.  I have many station locations memorized, but every now and then I need to consult a map to figure out where to go and where the closest station is.  Once I know I walk towards it, looking for the green globes on top of poles that indicate the station stairs are there and I can enter.  Sometimes I hear a subway roaring through the tunnels and I hurry down the steps to see if its my train.  Instead I see the express train speeding along the center track, because I am at a local stop and still have to wait for my train.  At the turnstile I swipe my card through the magnetic reader and the turnstile chimes and a green led light flashes go, and I can walk through the turnstile and onto the platform.  Once there I look down the tunnel and see the yellow glow of two train head lights.  The train is almost here so I step back and away from the edge and watch as the train pulls in, slowing down and stopping completely in the station.  Then I an all the other people pile in through the double doors.  There are enough seats so I sit down and the conductor announces the next stop, before the doors closing noise signals and the doors close shut.

I threw the filter with used grounds from yesterday into the trash and put a new filter in the basket, I measured out five tablespoons of coffee into the filter and five cups of water which I dumped into the water reservoir and turned the coffee maker on. I decided I wanted to eat oatmeal and peanut butter toast. I dumped a package of apple cinnamon oatmeal into a bowl and added enough water to cover it, stirred it and put it in the microwave for two minutes to cook. I put two pieces of Italian bread into the toaster and toasted them. When the toast was done, I put peanut butter on both slices. I removed the oatmeal from the microwave and it was perfectly thick like I like it. I spooned the oatmeal on top of the peanut butter toast. I poured some coffee in a mug and added two spoonfuls of sugar and creamer and was ready to eat.\n",

We ended up setting on an action movie and picked the 7:00 PM showing. We drove to the theater and walked up to the ticket window at 6:30 PM to purchase two tickets for the movie. Afterwards, we went inside to the concession stand, and bought a large popcorn and two small cokes to drink. We carried these to the entrance of the theater, and handed our tickets to the collector, who directed us to the second theater on our right. We entered the theater, and noticed that most of the seats were empty. We decided to sit in the very top row towards the middle.

There were some rusting spot, I did not know what to do. I tried 409 and somehow it worked. Those spots were very stubborn. The faucet in shower looked so dull, so I applied normal detergent liquid and it worked very well. Finally, the cleaner that bought, I sprayed at a time and cleaned square foot by square foot.

He starts his list for shopping by going through the kitchen, and checking anything he has missed or run out of.  Then he goes into the bathroom, to see what he needs to refill, and adds those to his list as well. By the time he has gone through the house, he has several things on the list.  He takes it to the grocery store, and goes through the whole list, checking things off as he goes. When he has all the list in his basket, he then buys everything he found, and brings it back to his home.

I went through every piece of clothing and folded it in a similar and orderly fashion. While I folded the clothes, I put each one down next to me and watched the TV. Upon finishing this activity, I put some clothes in the drawer and I hung other articles of clothing up. I felt that my room seemed much more cleaner and I felt accomplished.

Their dad took them on a trip a month ago, to a campground in the mountains.  It was very pretty, and it even had a place to park your camper, and set up your tents.  In the camp sites there was a little fire pit to make a fire on at night, and to cook with. When they got to the camp site, they made sure they set up their tents first.  Then they set up the fire, and put the coffee maker, and the food pots near the fire when they would use them for dinner.  Their dad always brings enough food , and he brings a treat too.  Usually, he brings smores to the camp site for the boys to make on the fire after dinner.

We also packed our tents, sleeping bags, and flashlights. Once we were all packed up we were read to go! We drove to the park and got our tents set up. They popped up easily and we staked them down carefully. Now we could enjoy the park. We hiked down to the river. An eagle soared above. After taking off our shoes and socks we hopped across from rock to rock. We grilled burgers and corn on the cob. Later in the evening we toasted marshmallows on crackers with chocolates.

In order to boil the milk, I first turned on my stove top and set the temperature to high. I then took out a saucepan and put the saucepan over the heat. Next, I went to my refrigerator. I took a half-gallon carton of milk out of the refrigerator. I put the carton on my kitchen counter, and then got out my measuring cups. I needed about two cups of milk to make my hot chocolate, so I poured and measured two cups of milk. I added the milk to the saucepan and covered the saucepan with a lid.

First, I went to my room to find my swimsuit, my sandals, my sunglasses, and my tote bag. I changed into my swimsuit, and put the sandals on my feet. Then, I grabbed a beach towel for each of us from the linen closet in the hallway. My sister reminded me that we need to protect our skin from the sun, so I went to the bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet to look for the sunscreen. I took it from the bottom shelf and threw it into my tote bag. Since the beach is close to our house, we decided to walk. We left our house, and walked for about 10 minutes until we got to the beach. Once we arrived at the beach, we had to look for a place to set down our things. My sister saw some of her friends, so we walked over to where they were sitting and placed our beach towels on the sand next to them. I sat down on my towel, and began putting on my body. My sister had to put the sunscreen on my back for me. I put on my sunglasses, and laid down to relax in the sun. It was a fun day.\n",

Me and my girlfriend went to the station, it is called BART to stand for \"Bay Area Rapid Transit\", and paid a person at a counter to obtain a pass good for everywhere you want to go that day. Then we walked through the turnstiles and went down an escalator to the platform where the train pulls in. We waited about five or ten minutes and the train came whooshing in through the big tunnel. The sliding doors opened, people came out and we got on. The ride was very smooth, but sometimes it wobbled a bit. Thankfully there are posts and railings to hold on to. It took us to our destination, where we got off at a similar platform and went up the escalator. At the end of the day we took it back.\n",

We stopped into the Vistor's Center and found a lot of information about what  there was to visit in Kearney.  My daughter's favorite place turned out to be the art museum.  This really surprised me!  As we parked the car in front of the museum, I explained to her that we had to speak softly, keep our hands off of the exhibits and not run around.  She had never been to a museum before.  The building was an old, big, stone building with several steps leading up to the main doors.  She raced up the steps and waited at the top for me.  When we opened the tall front doors we found out that the rooms were all spacious with high-ceilings.  There was a friendly guard there to greet us and a few other people like us who were there just to look around.  Each room featured a different type of art and one room was filled with just one artist's work.  My daughter took over 100 pictures of the art we saw that day and included a lot of those pictures in the scrapbook she made of our road trip to Kearney, Nebraska.\n",

I was dreading this experience, but knew that it had to be done. I got cleaning spray, towels, rags, etc and started to clean. I first cleaned the toilet and made sure the seat and all around it was clean. I took the rug out of the bathroom and scrubbed the floor. While doing this, I left the bath water running so that I could use the water to clean. After cleaning the floor, I began to clean the tub and I scrubbed until every bit of dirt was cleaned up.

I looked in the fridge and around my kitchen to see what ingredients I had and what I could make with them. I saw that I had eggs, cheese, and an assortment of veggies so I decided to make an omelette. First I cracked three eggs into a bowl and whisked them together, along with some salt and pepper. I then set the eggs aside. I turned on one of the stove burners and let a pan heat up while I chopped up some onion, green and red bell peppers, and spinach. I then poured olive oil into the pan and sauteed my veggies for a few minutes. Once the veggies were cooked, I poured my egg mixture into the pan. Then I grated some cheddar cheese on top and carefully folded the omelette using a spatula. Once the omelette was cooked through, I plated it and ate it for breakfast. It was delicious.\n",

The city is very busy, and parking can be hard to find, so it is often easier to take a taxi to get to place to place.  We had decided to go to dinner and see a play.  We walked to a street where taxis often go past, and waved to show the driver that we wanted a ride.  When we got in the taxi, the driver asked us where we wanted to go. I told the driver the name and address of the Thai restaurant my friend and I had planned to go to.  He was familiar with the location and we started to travel.  On he way, the driver told us that he also enjoyed Thai food and recommended the green curry at that restaurant.  As we were driving, I could see how much the cost of the trip would be as a screen displayed a slowly increasing cost.  We got to our destination, and I paid the driver the fee on the screen along with a small tip.\n",

I glance up at the sign board to see when my train is coming. Five more minutes it says. I wait, peering down the platform wishing it to come faster. Then it rolls into the station and the doors open. One or two people leave the car and I board. I move to the back of the car and take a seat.

I then sorted through the laundry in order to separate the dark colored clothes from the light colored clothes. I decided to wash only dark colored clothes today. I put these clothes in a laundry bag and took them to the laundry room in my apartment building, along with a bottle of laundry detergent and a roll of quarters, since the washing machine costs $2 and you can only pay with quarters. Luckily, there was a washing machine available to use. I poured one cupful of detergent into the machine. Then I placed the clothes in the machine.

We used to make pies and applesauce and I wanted to have that at my house . I went to the local nursery and I found a 6 foot tree . With delivery , it was pretty expensive , but I figured it was worth it . I dug out an area in my backyard . I was surprised at how long it took and how much dirt that I had to move . Digging the hole took me the longest time of the whole process . I finally got that done and I stuck the tree in the ground . I read online about a fertilizer that was good for apple trees and mixed that in with the dirt as I was filling in the area around the roots . I do n't expect to get any apples this year and probably not next year , but the tree should be mature enough to start producing apples in the following years . The whole process took me about 3 hours to get the tree planted . I wish I would have paid someone to do it for me .\n",

His mom took the food and put it in a pot on top of their gas stove, turned the stove on which lit up the flame using gas and heat, and in no time his food was cooked, warm and ready to eat!

The barber draped a piece of plastic around Todd 's shoulder so that hair would n't get on his clothes . The sound of the hair clippers tiny motor always had my boy on edge but he always sticks it out like a champ .

We found a nice pine tree that was just large enough to be a foot . We dug a nice hole in the ground , and insured the soil was the proper type to accept a tree of this size . It had to be nice and soft , and in a safe location where kids wo n't trample over it . I dug the hole about 4 '' '' deep and insured it was wide enough for the tree . We planted the tree and began to fill in the surrounding area of it with soil to make sure it would hold in place as perfect as possible . The tree looked perfect and was ready to withstand the first school year outside the new building .\n",

I arrived at the doctor's office, checked in, and presented my health insurance card. I had a five dollar co-pay. After I checked in, I sat down in the waiting room, which was empty. Soon, a nurse called my name; it was time for my appointment. She weighed me and measured my height. Then, she told me she would take my blood pressure. She put a cuff around my arm and secured it with Velcro. The cuff tightened and then loosened. My blood pressure was normal. After the blood pressure test, the nurse took my pulse. Then, she told me to put on a blue gown and wait for the doctor, who was in a room with another patient. The nurse then left the room.

After I clean the tops of the counters I go through with a vacuum and get all the debris from the floor.  I usually go over everything twice just to make sure I got it all.  After I finish with the vacuum I usually get my swiffer out.  Before I mop I removed all rugs and chairs from the area.  I will spray the floor with a solution.  Once the floor is covered I go through the entire floor with the mop pad until everything has been scrubbed.

After all that we needed was out I went ahead and chopped the necessary vegetables into bite size pieces. While I was cutting she brought out the big soup pot to make the soup in. I had all the ingredients in dishes so it was easy to put them in one at a time. My wife started by turning the heat on the pot full of water. Since she knew the recipe she told me what to add and at what moment. After about ten minutes everything was in the pot and just needed to finish cooking. We set the lid and waited for 45 minutes for it to finish cooking. Soon the whole house was filled with the smell of fresh veggie soup. This is when we knew it was ready to eat.

I crack the eggs into a bowl and then add some water or milk. I like milk better because it makes for fluffier eggs. Then I whisk them with a fork until everything is blended. My friends like their eggs cooked in butter so I heat a pan on the stove and then coat it in butter. Once the butter is melted I add the eggs. This is when I ask my friends if they want cheese and they all scream, \"Yes, of course we want cheese!\" So I add cheese and other spices.

I put in cleaning solution and scrub the toilet with a toilet brush.  Then I clean the window and mirror with glass cleaner.  After that, I disinfect the counters and sink with all purpose cleaner.  I then scrub the bath tub.  Next, I sweep the floors making sure I get all of the hair, dirt and dust.  After I'm done sweeping, I mop the floor with hot water and soap.  As I leave the bathroom, I grab the trash can and empty it out, and replacing it with a freshly lined trash can.  I let the floors dry.

I picked up the fish food container from the counter, but it was all out.  I got in my car and went to the pet store.  I bought some more fish food from the pet store.  I rushed home because I was worried that my fish was hungry.  I got home and went inside.  I opened the container of fish and reassured the fish that food was coming.  I turned the top of the fish container to open it up, and turned it upside down over the fish tank.  I tapped the container several times, and fish food fell onto the surface of the water.

Once I sit in the seat, I take a look at my mirrors, and I look to see if I am satisfied with their locations. Then I put on my seatbelt. I put my keys into the ignition and start the car. Once the engine is running, I put the car into reverse and I back out of my driveway. Once I get into the street, I quickly put the car into drive. While I drive, if I want to go to the right, I turn my steering wheel toward the right. If I want to go left, I turn my steering well left. While I'm driving, I keep a close eye on my surroundings. Are there any people walking in the street? Are there any dogs about to run into the road? If so, I need to pay close attention to where they are so I don't accidentally run into them. I also need to keep myself up to date about the weather---does it look like rain? I better be prepared to use my windshield wipers and turn on my headlights.

Our carpet which we put in the living room under the small table is an original from Rajasthan. It is a time consuming task and I went for it in a big way. I removed the carpet from under the Tea table and dragged it carefully to the open area near our dining room and placed it in such a way that I can see it clearly. It is heavy and beautifully designed colorfully. I had to rearrange the dining table and chairs to accommodate it in the room. I took my time vacuuming it as there is a big area to cover.

It was left full of belongings with graffiti on the walls, rotten food in a broken refrigerator, spiderwebs in every corner, and so on. After a few months, my parents, along with help from some relatives, began to clean out the house. One of the last things that they did before we began moving in was take out the carpets in some of the rooms. Instead of carpets, my parents wanted to put tile in the bedrooms that they took the carpets out of. They went to the hardware store and picked out a type of tile that they liked the best, and bought enough of it to cover the floors. They then proceeded to use cement that they bought to lay the tile on the ground one square at a time.

They called me in and I sat with the dentist and told him what was bothering me. He got some instruments out and looked inside of my mouth at the tooth that was bothering me. He said that it looked like a cavity, but he wasn't sure. He told me I would need x-rays. He brought me into the next room and had me bite down on a plastic device while the machine took x-rays of my mouth. We waited a while for them to get done and talked about my teeth. When they were done, he showed me that it was indeed a cavity, and that I would have to come back to get it filled. I made an appointment for the next week and left.

I put the key in the key in the ignition, twisting it to start my car and then adjusted the gear shift to reverse to pull out, then to drive to make my way out of my neighborhood. I cruised down 54, stopping at the occasional traffic light. There were a few pedestrians, but no one ignored the rules of the road, and I gave them their right of way when it was their turn at the crosswalks. I passed large school bus and the kids waved at me, so I waved back with a smile. My commute takes half an hour and I completed it in time to get into work early. I drove through the above ground parking deck, swiping my key card for access, until I reached the third level. I pulled into the parking space near the front of the building and set the gear to park. I got out of my card and locked it with the remote.\n",

I like to take photographs of many things, like people and objects, but today I'm taking a picture of a sunset. I set up my camera to be still on my tripod, but sometimes I like to set it on an object or just hold it in my hands. I check the settings on the camera to make sure the photo doesn't come out too bright or took dark. Then, I take my pictures! I like to take a lot of pictures of a single scene, so I can choose which ones are the best compared to the others. Once I'm done taking my photo, I put everything away in my bag for my camera equipment. Taking photos with a camera is very rewarding, and makes for memories that will last forever!\n",

If he turns it up too fast, it would burn the milk on the bottom of the pan. So, he is careful not to do that.  He stirs the milk constantly, until it gets to the boiling point. He uses a wire whisk to stir it. This is a good way to make sure the bottom does not burn.  You know if you are burning the milk if the milk starts to smell like it is burning, or tastes like it is burnt.  Jess's father does a nice job with the milk, and pours it into two cups for them to add what he wants to the warm milk.  He likes vanilla and sugar, so he adds that to their milk to drink.\n",

So I began to pack all of the things that we would need for our picnic. Of course we needed some food. I packed us all a sandwich, a piece of fruit, and a couple of cookies. Then I found a nice blanket that we could lay down on the ground for us to sit on while we ate. I put all of the things in the basket that I had found. Before we left I remembered to grab some water. We then walked down to the park down the street and laid out the blanket and proceeded to enjoy the wonderful picnic lunch that we had brought with us.

I took all of the dishes off of the table and made sure they had been rinsed to avoid any food being left over.  I plugged up one side of the sink and turned on some hot water to fill it up.  As it was pouring, I put in some dishwashing soap to make that side of the sink the soap side.  As each dish got finished being rinsed, I placed them in the soapy tub to get disinfected.

I booked my flight months in advance to be sure I would have transportation to my vacation destination . The day I was about to leave I went to the airport hours in advance because I was nervous and excited . I checked in at the correct terminal where the flight was supposed to leave from . A nice lady checked my ticket and confirmed that my flight was on schedule . I then proceeded to the security check station where officers checked my bags and personal belongings . After the quick screening and a short wait my plane boarded . I found my seat next to the window and was full of excitement . After some short instructions the plane taxied the runway and then sped up in a flash . I watched as the tires left the ground and we took to the sky .

After removing my back tire from the bicycle I let the remaining air out from the valve , and used the small tool on the edge of the tire , to lift the tire away and clicked the tool onto one of the spokes . Using more of the tools , I continued to lift the tire away from the rim until I could easily remove the rest of the tire with my fingers . By this time , the inner tube was exposed , and pushing the valve through , I removed the tube completely from the tire . I put the tube into a bucket of water , and used the air pump to pump air back into the tube , and watched for bubbles to see where the hole was . I kept a close eye on where the hole was , and taking the tube out of the bucket , I dried the tube with a towel . I used the small sandpaper from the kit , and carefully roughed the area around the hole . I then chose a patch . A round one for a puncture , or the rectangle for a slice . I placed glue on the patch , and firmly placed it on the tube . I was very careful , because last time I got glue on my fingers , and my fingers felt funny for days ! I went for some lemonade while I waited for the patch to dry . Boy , that lemonade was good on such a hot day . I tried pumping some air back in the tube , and carefully watched around the patch , to make sure no air was leaking . I was in luck , the patch was good . I carefully replaced the tube into the tire , and used the small tools to replace the tire into the rim and used the air pump to fill it back up . Now I was ready for more adventures ! \n",

I didn't want to get my clothes wet, so I undressed and stepped into the shower.  I turned the water on and waited to the side until the water warmed up.  Then I put my hair underneath the water and started to scrub my head.  After my hair was wet, I reached down and grabbed the shampoo that I was currently using.  It ran out, so I reached for another one.  I put the liquid in my hands and started rubbing them together.  When my hands were foamy, I rubbed them through my hair and started to scrub.

My friend had just left to go run some errands when I noticed that it smelled like Savannah's diaper needed to be changed. I pulled out her changing mat, gloves, and some wipes. I unfolded the changing mat on the ground, put on some gloves, and gently placed the baby on the changing mat. I unbuttoned the baby's onesie and took off her dirty diaper. I rolled the dirty diaper into itself and placed it in the diaper disposal can right next to me. I used some wipes to clean the baby off, then took a new diaper out of her diaper container. I opened up the new diaper and lifted up the baby's legs to put the diaper underneath her. I wrapped the diaper around the front and affixed the adhesive parts of the diaper to the front.

I pour a glass of wine while the water runs , and bring it with me into the bathroom . Once the tub is full , I finally allow myself to get in . Ah , perfect ! I lay back and let the hours of work just slip away . Sometimes I 'll bring a book in with me and sink into a good story as the hot water dulls away any aches and pains . I sip on my wine and enjoy the soft popping bubbles around me . When I have finally had enough , I 'll slowly drain the tub , and then get up and dry off with a huge fluffy towel .

I first threw the eggs on the stove pan and supplemented the edibles with salt and pepper - an American tradition. Next, I starting slicing and dicing the various food types I bought at the grocery store yesterday night. Unfortunately, I had no meat on hand, but I suppose this is beneficial and less damaging to the environment. The cereal and granola were easy, and were eventually mixed and added to a bowl of lush, thick, 2% milk. Next comes the absolute best part: I proceeded to devour the bulk of the preparation in one fell swoop. The food was short lived, but oh so satisfying.

I grabbed some bags to clean up his mess when we were outside. I put the bags in my pocket. I picked up his leash. I made sure I attached the leash in the proper way to his collar, so he would not accidentally break free of his leash. When he has his leash on and was ready, I put on my shoes and headed toward the door. I wanted to take him somewhere with a lot of grass, so I walked toward the park. Along the way he stopped to use the bathroom. He stopped to be petted and seen by other dogs. We walked for a long while and I used the bags to pick up any mess he made along the way.

I decided it was time to learn how to make them for myself, so I watched my mom as she was making dinner one night.  She put a pot of water on to boil as I stood behind her watching her every more.    I shook the box of pasta, and the hard shells rattled against the box.  When the water started boiling mom added the pasta to the water and stirred it with a spoon.  She set a timer on the stove for eight minutes to remind her to check on the pasta.  It was a long eight minutes when you are hungry.  She pulled a colander out of the cabinet and placed it in the sink.  Finally the timer dinged, and she removed the boiling water and pasta from the stove and poured it into the colander.  The water went through the tiny holes and left the cooked pasta in the bowl.  She added the steamy noodles back to the pot and added cheese.  Finally, Macaroni!\n",

I can recall this recipe being phenomenal. My favorite pasta is angel hair pasta, which I already had in my pantry, and all the other ingredients were in the refrigerator. I begin preparing my meal by putting a large pot of water to boil, adding a pinch of salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Once the water began to boil rapidly I dropped my pasta in and stirred, then I let it boil for about seven minutes. I prepared my sauce as the pasta boiled. To check the pasta I tasted one string of it, perfect, the pasta was drained. I plated my special meal, first the pasta then the sauce and a sprinkle of parsley. Delicious!!!\n",

Since I wanted to be able to see clearly in my kitchen, I made a short walk to our supply closet hoping that a spare light bulb would be there. Fortunately, we had one spare light bulb available, so I took it out of the package and headed to the kitchen. I could not reach the old light bulb without help, so I had to use a footstool to reach the light bulb located up near the ceiling. I carefully stepped up on the footstool and removed the old light bulb and threw it away in the trash can. Then I installed the new light bulb and the light immediately returned.

I forgot what side the opening was to put the gas into my car so had to drive to a different pump on the same side of the car to put the gas in. I do not like how gas smells so I go to the other side of the car while it is filling up. I found some trash in my car and gathered it all up and threw it away.

On the floor of our kitchen pantry there is a supply of cat food in several varieties.  We like to feed our cat both \"wet\" and \"dry\" cat food.  Wet cat food is usually moist and comes in cans.  Dry cat food generally comes in bags or boxes, much like the breakfast cereals people eat come in bags or boxes.  And, of course, dry cat food is dry.  Although we have wet cat food flavors ranging from seafood to pork, our cat enjoys chicken the most, so I opened a can of chicken-flavored cat food and placed its contents in her food bowl.  Next I scooped a good-size portion of dry cat food and placed it in the cat's food bowl.  Finally, I put fresh water in a separate bowl.

I am not sure if it is the flavor of the coffee or the smell and sound of the coffee that I enjoy the most. The first thing I do when I wake up is change my clothes and brush my teeth. The very next thing I do is head to the kitchen to make coffee. I first choose my cup for the day. My favorite is an insulated stainless steel lidded cup that keeps the coffee burning hot. Next, I fill the cup with water and pour it into the coffee maker. I then add coffee grinds to the coffee maker single serving basket. I also push the grinds down with a small juice cup, in hopes that it makes it stronger. I press start and the drip begins! 5 minutes later, I have a cup of coffee in my cup. I add some flavored creamer, place my lid on and I am set for the day.\n",

After a short conversation we decided on turquoise. Everyone got into the car to go to Lowe's to pick up some paint and supplies. We went to the display with the colored squares and found the one that was closest to the color we had picked and handed that square to the person working so she could mix it for us. When we had the paint it was time to get other supplies. We bought a paint roller with a tray and two paint brushes and some tape to keep everything neat. We got in the car and went back home. We used the tape to separate the area to be painted so that the color would not get anywhere we did not want it. We set up the tray and paint roller then passed out brushes. Everyone took turns painting the wall. We rested when we were finished to give the paint time to dry.\n",

I put a date on the top so I know it is this weeks list and list everything I need to get for that week. Sometimes l list the store next to the item if I need to make a special trip to a special kind of store. For groceries, the list is just random. I like to group them if they are related or located in a nearby section in the grocery store but it's generally random as I think about each item. I may draw boxes or line to separate the categories or stores. Generally, I use a weird color ink so I easily recognize that it is my list and it makes shopping errands happen more quickly and efficiently.\n",

I and my brother Kevin took the responsibility to prepare the juice. Our parents shopped good, fresh oranges. I and Kevin peeled the oranges well. Once we done peeling all the oranges, we blend them all using a blender. Then we filtered the juice with a filter to get pure juice. Kevin tasted the juice and complained that the juice was very tangy. So we added some water and sugar to it to get good taste. If we add more water, the taste of the juice will get spoiled. So we added water little by little. Finally we got good taste. We asked our mom to taste the juice and finalize it. She also liked the juice and we were very happy on the preparation of our first fresh orange juice.\n",

Maybe it was one of my neighbors needing something. Maybe it was someone selling something. I got up from my place at the table where I was working on my book. I am a writer and I work from home.

I chose to toast the cinnamon raisin bread, because I thought the sweetness would be a nice compliment to the saltiness of the bacon and eggs. I placed two slices of the bread in the toaster at a time. I did this three times, for a total of six slices of bread. We all like our bread only slightly toasted, so this did not take a long time. Once they were all toasted, I spread a thin layer of butter onto each slice of toast. Then I placed two slices of toast on each plate, along with three strips of bacon and a pile of scrambled eggs.

After we took the tilapia home, we began our preparation.  We retrieved a pan from the cabinet, put some oil in it, and squeezed one whole lemon in the oil.  We turned the heat to medium high.  I was so excited because my daughter was able to help me with all of these steps as she just turned 9 last week.  We laughed and danced while the oil was heating up.  We then proceeded to put the fish in the oil .  We added a small amount of garlic and pepper to the top and let it simmer for a few minutes.  While it was simmering my daughter told me about her day at school.  She had a busy day so it was nice to hear all about it.  We flipped the fish over and let it cook for another 3-4 minutes and then it was done.  We ate that tilapia with mashed potatoes and a salad.  It was delicious.\n",

I pulled out burger patties from the fridge and placed them in the hot skillet. While they were frying, I got frozen French fries out of the freezer, put them on a baking sheet, and put them in the oven once it had preheated. I set the timer for 16 minutes, which was the recommended on the fry bag. I also got out the hamburger buns, ketchup, mustard, onion, cheese, pickles, and lettuce for people to put on their burgers. By this time, the burgers were ready to be flipped, which I did using a metal spatula. The timer went off for the fries, so I took them out of the oven carefully with oven mitts on and set them out to cool. I got out plates and napkins and set the table.

Not knowing what to really do with all these oranges, I came up with the idea of making fresh juice out of them. In order to do this, I knew that we needed to peel the oranges, and we needed to but them inside of a blender or food processor. We had all of this, so we figured it would be easy. One by one, I peeled all of the oranges. My mom cut them open to take out as much of the seeds as possible. Once we were sure that she got out enough of the seeds, we put the oranges in the blender and blended it into a perfect juice.

I'll look through my fridge, freezer and cabinets to see what I am low on and need to restock that I use regularly; coffee, stevia, mint tea bags, paper towels. I'll also check to see if I need anything like shampoo or deodorant. When I get the grocery store ads and coupons in the mail I will look through to see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for and I will plan my meals based on what I can get at a good price. Once I have figured out meals I'll check to see if there are ingredients that I already have. I will then make my list organized according to what I can get at what store. I do the majority of my shopping at one store so that will be the big chunk of the list but there are some things that I have to go to other stores for, I will put that on the other side of the paper.

I first checked to see if it needed gas, and then added some from the gas can I keep in the garage. Now that I was ready to mow, I put on my work gloves, and rolled the mower outside. Then I opened the gas flow on the engine and then shifted the throttle lever to the bunny rabbit setting, for full. Then I pulled the cord fast, and the mower started up. I moved the throttle lever down to the work setting and shifted the blade lever to on, and started mowing. I started right in front of the house, making a big circle to border by the street. I was sure to mow so I was facing oncoming traffic, because my house doesn't have a sidewalk. I kept mowing in a big circle until I got into the middle, where the bird bath is. I moved it aside, mowed that patch, and then the front lawn was done. I took the mower back into the garage, closed the gas flow lever, and then went inside and had a lemonade.\n",

We picked the route we wanted to take to go visit my uncle , and had everything ready the day before , such as our suitcases . When the day arrived for us to go , my dad drove us to the train station where we parked in a designated lot , since we would be returning to the same train station . We then headed to the train station and went inside where my dad purchased our tickets . We had some extra time , so we wandered around and found a little gift shop where we could buy souvenirs . When it was time to board our train , we walked through the station to get to the correct area . There were long hallways to get there , and then we went up a concrete pathway to where the train was outside . We had to give the ticket taker our tickets so she could verify we were getting on the right train . We all gathered in the train and found some seats that had n't been taken . We stored our luggage and prepared for the train to begin its journey . Once it was time to leave , we watched out the windows at all the passing scenery . After awhile , we all started doing our own thing like reading or playing cards to pass the time . It was a lot of fun and really neat to take a train trip . \n",

I rinsed it well, then refilled it water. I filled it with enough water to make six cups, to the line that said six. I lifted the back of the coffee maker, where the water goes, and poured the water from the pit into it. Once I did that I placed the pot itself back on the base. I went to the cupboard and got out the can of coffee grounds. I grabbed a coffee filter as well. I put the coffee filter into the filter crate. I then carefully, using a spoon, measure three table spoons of coffee grounds from the can, putting them into the coffee filter. I closed the coffee filter crate and plugged the coffee maker in.

I got the vacuum out of the closet and picked up everything up off of the floor. After I plugged the vacuum in I proceeded to vacuum the carpet of the living room and playroom. After I was done with these rooms I had to move to different rooms. I unplugged the vacuum and moved to the hallway where I would have enough cord to access the other rooms that I needed to vacuum. I turned on the vacuum and proceeded to vacuum the hallway, the master bedroom, and my daughters room. When I got to my sons room I found that I had to stop and pick up a few more things before I vacuumed. When I was done I unplugged the cord, rolled it up, and placed the vacuum back in the closet.\n",

I drove all the way there and when I got to her house, she had lemonade and cookies ready for me. We sat down on her couch and I ate a bunch of cookies while we caught up. She asked me if I wanted to go on a walk with her, and I agreed. We walked through her neighborhood and stopped to talk to one of her neighbors. She talked about the houses and the various people who lived there. We talked more about my family and my job before we went back to her house. We then had some crackers and looked at old pictures.

I saw that they had a coupon for ten dollars off your order.  I got one large pepperoni pizza and one pizza with hamburger and peppers.  I added a soda onto the order because we didn't have any in the refrigerator.  As a treat I added some cinnamon sticks.  When I was done with my order I clicked on a button that said \"Finish Order\".  I got my credit card out of my purse and put in my card number.  A countdown box appeared showing me how long it would be until my pizza was there.  About thirty minutes later my doorbell rang and I got some cash out of my purse for a tip to give to the driver.

They floated on the water as my fish swam over and started to eat.

There had been no line at the turnstile when he put in his ticket to open the fare gate. The escalator had been a little bit crowded, but it always was at this time of day, when so many got off work. However, when he got down to the platform he saw there was a huge crowd waiting for a train. He heard someone in the crowd say that there was a train stalled at the last station. However, the next thing he heard was the tooting of a train approaching the platform. Soon he was able to take his place in the car.

I also didn't want  to have to go out anywhere to get it so I made it myself. I put the broth into a large bowl and boiled it.

I then put in two bottles of water with an ice pack. I also packed a bottle of wine and two glasses made of plastic. Finally on top, I put in a blanket to sit on. The blanket was blue and sturdy. We drove out to the lake and wandered around for a while for the perfect picnic spot. I wanted to sit close to the lake and still have shade. Once I found a nice big tree that was close to the lake, I spread out my blanket. I enjoyed having my picnic. The breeze was nice and the sun kept us warm while we enjoyed nature.\n",

After much deliberation we decided to rip out the worn, cracked tiles in the kitchen and put in a new tile floor. We measured everything one last time. Then, starting at the far end of the kitchen I knelt down and began spreading the pasty grout across the floor. I took one tile and placed it in the corner, pressing on it to set it in well. Then I picked up another tile and set it next to the first. I continued to move across the back wall of the kitchen in this manner, occasionally scrapping any extra grout back into the bucket. When the first row was in place, I backed up and spread more grout so I could start laying another row of tiles. I repeated this until the whole floor was done and I was exhausted.\n",

I decided that I was going to be safe, so I bought some toys to keep me company.  When the night time came around, though, I felt a little bit more scared.  When I was watching a scary movie downstairs, I heard the doorbell ring.  I didn't really want to answer it, but I decided that I should in case it was someone important for my parents that was over.  I went up the stairs and looked out the window.  I couldn't see who was on the porch, but mustered up the courage to answer the door anyway.  When I opened the door, all I could hear was the wind outside.  I couldn't see anyone there.

I got out the tomato soup cans that were given to me and opened them up for the cats.  I poured the soup into a bowl for each of the five cats.  They looked at me for a second in gratitude and then began to eat from each of their bowls.  The cats ate all of the food in a very short amount of time.

Once the temperature was pleasing to me , I put the stopper in the tub and let the tub fill with water . I also poured some bubble bath into the water stream so that bubbles filled the tub . Once the tub was filled with water and bubbles , I took off my clothes and sat down in the tub . I submerged my body in the soapy water . I used a loofah to wash myself .

When I think I'm either sick or just to make sure I'm healthy I make a doctor appointment. I call the doctor's office and make the first available appointment. When it's 20 minutes before it's time for my appointment, I leave my house to go. Once I get to the doctor office I find a place to park. I walk inside the doctor's office and check in with the receptionist. I got wait in the waiting room for my name to be called. Once they call my name I go straight to the scale to get weighed, I always hate this part. Then the nurse takes me to the room, takes my blood pressure and asks why I'm there. I'm only there to check my cholesterol since last time I had it checked it was high. The doctor then comes in to talk about my last results and says that we will check it again today and then call him back in 3 months if it's high to talk about my options. I then go get my blood drawn in the lab. After that is done I go to the check out window and pay my copay for my visit.\n",

I put them on the floor, as I will eventually clean them in the washing machine.  I then remove the sheets from the bed, first the top sheet and then the fitted sheet.  I have to walk around the whole bed to get it off because my bed is very large.  I carry the sheets to the washing machine and clean them.  I dry them in the dryer after they are clean.  I take them out of the dryer when they are clean and warm.  I then put them back on the bed, 1st the fitted sheet and then the top sheet.  The fitted sheet takes more time because I have to put it on the correct way.  Sometimes I get it wrong and have to turn it around and try again.  After putting the top sheet on, I pick up the rest of the blankets and wash/dry them also.\n",

I start by throwing all the clothes into the washing machine followed by using whatever laundry detergent I have at the time.

The problem was that the ceiling in my living room is very tall and it can't be reached without a ladder. The first thing I had to do was to go to the hardware store to buy a replacement bulb. I didn't have any extra ones in my house. When I got back from the store I took the tallest ladder I have out of my garage and brought it into the living room. I then got an extension tool that I can use to make my reach longer and I got onto the ladder and stretched up as high as I could with the extension tool to unscrew the burned out bulb. Then I put the new bulb on the end of the extension tool and reached up to screw it back in. After that I flipped the light switch to make sure it worked and it did!\n",

As it was a busy night it took a minute for them to answer the phone. When the employee answered he asked what I would like. I first asked to hear the specials, I like to save a buck when I can. He told  me some various specials and so I decided to go with one of those. I ordered a pizza with pepperoni, a bottle of cola, and some garlic bread sticks. He told me my total and I paid over the phone using my credit card. He told me it would be about forty-five minutes before the food arrived. I thanked him and waited for my food to arrive. about thirty minutes later there was a knock at my door and it was the delivery guy. He was very polite and I tipped him nicely.

I put them into baskets and took them to my laundry room. I put two detergent pods in my washing machine and then put in the clothes from one of the baskets. I made sure the wash settings were how I wanted them and then closed the washing machine and started it. Once the wash cycle had ended, I took the clothes out of the washing machine and put them in the dryer. I added a dryer sheet and adjusted the settings, and then I closed the dryer and started it. When the clothes had finished drying, I took them out and folded them neatly and put them away in my room. Then, I did the same thing with the next load of laundry.\n",

I then used a wet nap to wipe her body and make sure that she was clean. After that, I put a little baby powder on her and put started to put a new diaper on here. During the whole process, she was having difficulty sitting still, shaking and moving her legs the entire time. This process was somewhat difficult because she would not sit still. Upon putting her diaper on, I then put her shirt on and let her lay there for a minute while I threw everything out. She seemed content and happy and she was definitely clean.

After it 's closed I like to run both hot and cold water to make warm water and then I let the tub fill up to about a hand 's height from the top of the tub . While the water is running , I squirt in bubbles and make sure I have a clean washcloth and towel . After I carefully climb into the tub , I make sure I wash my whole body with the soap and washcloth , even behind my ears and between my toes . Then I can either soak and relax in the tub or I can play with toys . Fun toys for the bathtub are boats and plastic water animals like whales and ducks . Once the water starts to turn a little cold , it 's time to get out so I open the drain again and let the water empty out . While it 's draining I carefully stand up and reach for my towel to dry off . I always be sure the tub is clean when I 'm finished , with toys and the dirty washcloth put where they belong . \n",

I trimmed the edges of the wall with a small paint brush. When the pan ran low on paint, I poured more into the pan from the paint can. I waited for the wall of paint to dry, then applied a second layer of purple paint. I touched up areas before cleaning up the paint and washing out my brushes.\n",

I picked a piece of clothing out of the basket. It was a T-shirt. I held the T-shirt up against my body so it hung down without any wrinkles. Then I folded it in half horizontally. Holding it by its folded seam, I folded it again, this time vertically. My T-shirt was now folded. It is flat and does not have any wrinkles or bulges. I place it on my table neatly. I pick the next piece of clothing out of the basket. It is shorts. I hold these by the waistband and fold only once, vertically. I put them on top of the T-shirt on the table. This is my pile of folded clothes. I pick up the next piece of clothing. It is a pair of jeans. I hold them by the waistband and shake gently to release any wrinkles. I fold once vertically (vertically is the way the zipper of the jeans runs-up and down). Then I fold them again, in half with a horizontal folded seam. I place these in my pile of folded clothes. I continue until the basket is empty.\n",

I put the sheets & pillow cases in the basket and put the comforter on top of the basket. After washing and drying all of my laundry, I put the fitted sheet on the bed starting at the top right corner. I found the bottom of the sheet and put it on the bed, trying to center it the best I could. I tucked the bottom of the sheet between the mattress and box spring. I put the pillows in the pillowcases and put two pillows on each side of the bed, at the top. I pulled up the sheet so it partially covered the pillows.

I knew I had to change my garbage bag. I took the lid off of my garbage can, and took the bag out. I tied it up in a knot, making sure to tie it tight so no garbage could fall out. I went out the door to my yard, where my big garbage bins are. I put the trash bag in the bin, so the garbage truck can take it away when it comes around. Then, I went back inside and got a new bag out of my cabinet. I placed it in the garbage can, making sure to fold the opening of the bag securely around the lip of the can.

The first thing we did was talk about the theme of the party. We decided on the theme of \"Something Blue\". We would have all colors of blue and activities that have titles with the word blue for the whole weekend. Next, I needed a guest list from her. She gave me a list of 20 girls. I created an invitation that had blue and included a picture of her. I also included an itinerary of our weekend activities with all of our fun \"blue\" titles, to set the fun mood. I printed each invitation out, placed them in the blue envelope and added the itinerary.

He was nothing if not constant. She quietly got up and went into the kitchen. She picked up her little black address book and started to flip through it.

They also dressed my younger brother and themselves very nicely. We showed up to the wedding right on schedule. It was being held in a local wedding hall, so the atmosphere was very calm and quiet. We were around several other family members who were also there in support. We all watched as the wedding ceremony took place.

I called him over to the door and got his leash off the hook on the wall.  I clipped it to his collar and we went out.  There is a wooded walking trail by my house so I decided that's where we should walk today.  Oscar pulled on the leash when we got in the woods because he wanted to smell so many things.  We walked along the path for quite a while until we got to the lake. I sat on the bench by the lake and Oscar sat with me, looking at the ducks on the water.  After a little while we got up and walked back home.  When we got home, I took off Oscar's leash and he went to rest in the living room.\n",

I looked in my pantry and saw spaghetti, ravioli, tortellini and angel hair.  I decided I'd cook a pot of spaghetti.  I took the box out and set it on the counter. I then pulled a large deep pot out of the cupboard.  I filled it with water 3/4 full.  I then put it on a burner on the stove.  I poured into it a little olive oil and shook a little salt in the water. This is too ensure the pasta does not stick together while it is cooking. I then put the lid on the pot and turned on the burner to high.  I needed to wait about 10 minutes for the water to start boiling. When it was boiling, I took off the lid and set it onto the counter. I picked up the box of pasta, opened the lid and took half of it out.  It is long strands of dry pasta. I held it all in one hand around the middle. I then held the bottom ends above the water and slowly lowered the whole batch into the water spreading it around in a circle.  As the pasta became moister it lowered into the water until all of it was submerged.  I lowered the heat so that it was at a low boil or simmer.  I then set the timer for 10 minutes.  When the timer dinged, I pulled out one and tested it to see if it was done. It was perfectly al dente.  I took the pot off the stove and poured out the contents into a strainer. It was finished.\n",

Once my mom arrived at our apartment and we got the kids all settled in for the night, we called a taxi and headed downstairs to wait for it. Not too long later, a yellow taxi pulled up to the curb for us. We got in and my husband double checked the flat rate and mileage price before we got going. He told him the location of the theater that we would be watching our movie at and the taxi driver took us off into traffic. Several minutes later we arrived at our destination, the theater. The taxi driver pulled over and let us out. My husband asked him how much the total would be.

I packed the camera into a shoulder bag and placed some extra batteries in beside it. I drove out to the trail head and parked my car before preparing for the hike. About 20 minutes into walking, I noticed a particularly beautiful blue jay perched on a branch above my head. I quietly and quickly produced my camera from it's bag and turned on the power. Once it was loaded I brought the camera to my eye and centered the blue jay on the screen. I waited until he turned his head toward me and snapped several pictures of him. After the blue jay had flown off, I took a moment to examine my pictures. I selected the one I liked the most and deleted the rest.\n",

My girl and I shower and get dressed in our favorite trendy clothes, wear our favorite scents and she takes 30 minutes doing her makeup. Making sure we each have our phones, keys, and payment cards, we lock the door and head to the car. It takes about 30 minutes to get to the nearest shopping center. We prefer to park near the back because it's closer to a door and the stores we prefer within the shopping center. As always we beeline for our favorite stores first, then our second favorites taking about thirty minutes in each store. We go back and forth looking for the best deals too. We really enjoy helping each other pick out clothes that look good on us. Once we are done shopping we usually discuss which restaurant we would like to go to. It's usually The Chinese buffet and sushi bar across the street or the Arby's a little further away...we fins out that the Arby's has closed.

I will need a sponge and a mop and bucket to clean the floor, a brush and some cleaning chemicals.  I'll start with the shower. I'll put some cleaning chemicals on the walls first, and then scrub them with a brush, making sure to get into the corners! Then, I'll do the floor of the shower, and clean around the drain. Then, turn on the shower and rinse it out  really well. Next, I'll do the toilet. The inside first, using some chemical and a  brush, then a good  flush! then with a sponge, clean the outside, rinsing the sponge off and wiping it all around. Last, it's time to mop the floor. I'll need to pick up the stuff in the way, like the trash can and the rug and put those outside the door.Then I'll mix some cleaning chemicals and warm water in the bucket, and get the mop wet and mop the floor, rinsing the mop in the sink, we'll clean that last. We'll mop our way out the door and let the floor dry. When it's dry and shiny, come back in and dump out the bucket and  rinse our mop in the sink, then clean the sink and counter.

I've heard a little bit about this play, and decided I would go to see it for some fun. The theater downtown is where the play was at. I made sure to change my clothes into something clean and nice, and I brushed my hair really well. It is important to look nice at the theater to be polite and show you care about the people in the play. They work very hard and want to make you happy. I drove to the theater and talked to a man inside a booth to buy a ticket. My ticket was not as expensive as other peoples' because I was in school, so they did not make me pay as much.

A few weeks before, we discussed which restaurant to go to and decided to go to Yuzu, a nice Japanese restaurant we have been to before with really delicious sushi and small plates. I looked up the phone number for Yuzu on the Internet, and called them to make a dinner reservation. I asked if they had any reservations available for the night of our anniversary. They said yes. I asked if I could please have a reservation for two people at 8pm. They said the 8pm slot was all booked up and asked if we were available to come in at 8:30pm instead. I agreed and said the 8:30pm reservation time would be fine. After we hung up, Yuzu sent me a confirmation email.

Pulling the bag out was heavy and difficult, but I finally got it up and out. I tied it tightly so nothing would come out and took it outside to the big trash can by the curb. When I got inside, I took a fresh bag from the cabinet under the kitchen sink. The scented bags I had ordered online had a pleasing scent and helped mask the left over scent of the old garbage I had just taken out. I pulled open the top of the bag and shook it out to make it expand. I slid it down in the can and secured the ends tightly around the can to make sure it didn't slip down in the can.

The food was going to be ready in a few minutes, so I set the table. I grabbed four plates out of the cupboard and some silverware out of the drawer. I put them on the table and arranged them so they would look nice. I then grabbed two cloth napkins I have for special occasions out of the drawer in the kitchen. I folded them so they looked fancy and put them next to the plates on the table. Then, I grabbed a nice tall candlestick out of a drawer and lit it.

We were having Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes and corn. It was one of the most delicious meals I've had in a long time, but the worst part isn't even the wait. It's always having to clean up afterwards; I always have to help my parents clean the table off after dinner each night, but tonight while helping them clean off the table I accidentally dropped one of the plates onto the table and chipped a chunk off the ceramic. I immediately looked at my parents in horror, because I thought I was going to be in so much trouble. They both just burst out laughing and I didn't understand why it was so funny to them. They just smiled and explained that they were actually just talking about how much they hated that particular plate-which was a gift to them from my grandmother- and that it was ironic that was the plate I broke.

Since he has baseball practice on Sunday, he wants to cut the grass on Saturday.  Jack starts by going out to the shed, and pulling out the lawn mower.  It is a nice riding one, with a big red paint job.  He checks to see if it has any gas, fills it with some gasoline from the container in the shed, and pulls it out of the shed carefully onto the grass.  He starts with the back yard, because it is the biggest part of the lawn. He puts his cap on, starts the engine by pressing the start button, and the engine roars to life.  He jumps on the seat, and presses the gas peddle.  The lawn mower rolls forward, and Jack tries to go in straight lines as he goes across the lawn, front and back yards. By the time he is finished, the lawn has nice straight lines where he mowed the grass, and the grass is short and neat.\n",

First I have to find out if admission is free or if there a cost for entry. A simple Internet search is all I needed to do to find that out. It was free of cost on certain days, so I decided on one of those days. Then I planned on my transportation method and decided to take a bike ride there. I made sure to pack proper previsions such as drinks and snacks. I also made sure to pack a camera because a museum is a great place to take pictures. Once I took my bike ride there and entered, I had a look around at all the exhibits. I also made sure to learn as much as possible and took pictures of things that stood out and I liked.

The dispatcher asked me several questions, the first of which was \"What is your emergency?\". I described exactly what was going on, where my grandfather lived, and his past medical history. I stayed on the phone with the dispatcher until the ambulance arrived a few minutes later. We let the EMTs into the front door. They carried a stretcher with them and several pieces of equipment to check his vital signs. They eventually were able to move him onto the stretcher and roll him out the door and into the ambulance.

We had eggs, bacon, toast, juice and strawberries.  First I sliced the fresh strawberries, and placed sugar on them and out them in the refrigerator to keep them cool.  Next I fried the eggs.  To do this I put a small amount of vegetable oil in the pan and heated it.  Then I cracked the eggs and fried them in the pan, flipping them once with a spatula.  After removing the cooked eggs from the pan I fried the bacon in the pan, turning it so both sides browned, and removing it when it was just crispy.

It was in the late afternoon, and the weather made it feel very warm inside the old church. I walked into the church, signed the guest book, and found a seat in a pew to the left. We sat and waited for the ceremony to start, enjoying the pianist that was playing classical music while the guests were seated. Eventually, the family of the bride and groom were seated and the ceremony began. The bridesmaids walked in. followed by the flower girl, ring bearer, and bride. She was walked down the aisle with her father. She looked absolutely beautiful in a fitted white gown that looked vintage-inspired. Her father gave her to the groom and they began to say their vows. The officiant then pronounced them man and wife, and they kissed for the first time and husband and wife.\n",

I like to drive to New York because if I take public transportation then I am not allowed to take my dog, and my plan was to bring him to New York to visit my friend and her small dog.  I was originally planning to leave on Friday night but I altered my plan to leave early Saturday morning to avoid some traffic.  We woke up early and were in the car at 6:00 am.  I tucked my dog safely in the back of the car and I jumped into the drivers seat.  I started the car and began driving towards New York.  The traffic was really light and the roads were clear.

I quickly realized the screeching noise was my smoke detector, and my house was on fire! I grabbed my cell phone and my dog and we ran out of the house into the street. I knew I needed to reach the fire department. I turned on my cell phone and dialed the numbers that my mother taught me, when I was very small, to dial in an emergency. Those number were 9, then 1, then 1. Right away, a man answered and asked me what was wrong. I yelled, \"My house is on fire!\". He told me to stay calm, and to give him my address. Even though I was nervous, I was able to slowly and clearly tell him my address. He said to stay far away from the house, and the firemen would be there very soon. In just a couple of minutes, a big red fire truck pulled up to my house and put out the fire very quickly. Thankfully, my dog and I were fine, and my neighbors let me stay with them that night.\n",

I got the outfit that I wanted to wear, a shit and a pair of pants. I pulled in the iron to let it pre heat. While pre heating, I read the label on the shirt to see what temperature to iron it on. It is a cotton shirt with printed logo of my favorite band. To avoid melting the design, I placed the iron on a low temp and placed a towel over the shirt so the iron would not touch the design. I ironed the shirt sleeves first , starting with the shoulder and working my way back and forth perpendicular to the fibers towards the arm opening. I repeated the process for the body of the shirt, then hung it on a hanger while I ironed the pants . The pants would need to be ironed at a higher temperature, So I turned the iron up, placed the jeans on the ironing board with the jeans laying there like someone where wearing them.

It was my son's bed time by the time the 911 learning video ended.  While tucking my son in bed, we went over some of the things we learned.  My son correctly listed quite a few good examples someone might call 911 for: a fire (after leaving the burning),  a medical emergency (such as a severe, life-threatening accident or illness), or when we might need help from the police (an intruder trying to break into a home), and so on.  Proud of him, I kissed him goodnight and went to read a book.  A few minutes later, our doorbell rang.  Bewildered at who might ring our doorbell so late, I looked to see who was at the front door through a window.  The police! Opening the door, I asked the police officers if I could help them.  I was informed they received a call from someone at our address.  I could only chuckle and shake my head.  I brought my son to the front door, since he had a little explaining to do.  My son apologized for calling 911 when there was no emergency.  He had wanted to see what would happen if he dialed 911.  The officers were understanding, but reminded my son that 911 is really for emergencies only so they can be ready and available for true emergencies.  All in all, we think he learned his lesson!\n",

Luckily, I had a sewing kit. I pulled the kit out and looked through it, trying to find a good thread and a needle. It took me a while to find a needle because of how many things are in my kit. Once I found the needle, I threaded it with the thread. I put the shirt on a flat surface and placed the button where it needed to be. Very carefully, I put the needle through the button holes and through the back of the shirt. I pulled the string tight with each pass, and the button became more and more secure. On the last pass, I pulled it tight and made a knot. It came out perfect, and the button looked like it never fell off in the first place.\n",

He lived in a small town about 2 hours by car north of the larger town when we kids lived with our mom . We would go visit my dad every other weekend . My grandfather was a pilot too and had a small plane . His was smaller , though , and only seated 2 people . It was fun to fly in because I got to sit in front and see out the front and watch him work the controls . When we flew with my dad , my stepmother sat in the front seat and all three of us kids sat in the back seat . We were small , so we all fit . There was n't much room for luggage , but my dad would load the luggage behind the back seat . Then he would do the preflight checks . Some of these were outside the plane , but most of them were done from the inside . He would radio the tower and ask for permission to take off . This was always very exciting . The takeoff was a little scary because in a plane that small you could really feel the wind and the forces of the take off . The flight itself was fairly boring because you could n't really see anything from the back . Sadly , I had bad motion sickness , and my main memory of the landings is throwing up down the back of my dad 's neck .\n",

First, we dug a shallow hole in the sand, laughing and singing along to the music that was blasting out of our boombox. We surrounded the pit with large rocks we found at the bottom of the beachside cliffs that grew up behind us, and then began to toss in the driest driftwood we could find. We topped it off with long branches that leaned in together like a tend, and then got ready to start the fire! We took a rolled up newspaper to make a makeshift torch, using a lighter to set the end on fire, and then pushed it into the logs. It was slow to catch, but soon the branches and logs began to smoke and smoulder. We threw in some dry grass and then the fire really started to blaze! As the sun set behind us, we gathered around the growing fire and watched the flames flicker in the wind.\n",

When my train arrived , everyone waiting for that train lined up and walked through the gate while the attendant checked our tickets . Once I walked through the gate , I went outside and boarded the train . Thankfully I was able to sit alone , and I pulled out a magazine to read .

There are literally pounds of clothes.  So we all work together.  My brother folds the pants.  My sister folds the shirts.  My mom sorts the stacks.  I usually fold the socks and such.  When my mom sorts the stacks, sometimes she knocks some of the clothes over.  I usually re-fold those clothes as well.  My brother does not like how we fold his clothes.  He decided to do it differently.  He started unfolding all of his clothes, and rolling them up into a sleeping bag shape.  He said that it kept away the wrinkles.

The first thing they will do is sit down and decide what kind of ideas Jenny has about what she would like her to look like now. After a few days of looking through some teen magazines Jenny decided she wanted her room to look tropical and have a hammock like she was in the jungle. They went to look at paint colors to see what inspired them for a design. While they were there they saw a huge floor to ceiling wallpaper poster of a jungle scene. Jenny and her mom agreed this was a great idea as a start. They bought the poster mural and some matching shades of green paint and went home to start their project.

I 'd already tried using my bike pump ; it would inflate a little but I could never get it anywhere close to fully inflated . I know from past experience those fix-a-flat or emergency bike repair kits are pretty worthless . I think they 're made for the narrow old tires you 'd see on ten-speed street bikes . I have a mountain bike with large tires and a lot of pressure is needed to keep them inflated . Since I only live a few blocks from a bicycle repair shop I decided to take the bike there . I bought it at that shop anyway so I figured they 'd do the service for free , as promised . I stopped by , they took it in the back , replaced the inner tube of the tire , inflated it , and it was as good as new . Best of all , they only charged me ten bucks for the tube . That 's the beauty of local , independently own businesses . They really care about their customers . \n",

I drove to the store and got out and walked inside . After making a short list in my head , I wandered the aisles and grabbed the chicken , fresh vegetables and all of the necessary ingredients for the meal , as it has a lot of them . After grabbing everything I needed I then walked to the checkout counter . It was a very long line and I had to wait for a long time to purchase my items . The cashier apologized over and over and thanked me for being so patient . I then paid for my items and walked out to my car .

Sometimes , when I do n't get a haircut , I look like a really scary homeless man . This is often because I do n't shave my big beard either . Whenever I get a haircut , it is when I also get a shave . So this means that I am often unshaven for three months straight . Since , I wanted to go back into the world again , I knew it was time for a new hair cut and shave . I went to the neighborhood Barber , Santiago 's , and got a hair cut and shave . He first used scissors to trim my hair into something manageable , then he used a electric trimmer to buzz some of my side burns off . He then continued using his scissors and cut my hair into something that was acceptable . He also had to take a few minutes to shave off my beard . First he trimmed the excess off with his electric trimmer . Then he proceeded to use a knife and shaving cream to give me a very deep shave . It costed a total of 50 dollars . This was n't bad considering I got a new hair cut , I was shaved , and they even offered to wash my hair for free . \n",

Then he continued the place it under the bed so it fit snuggly and stretch out the bed sheet again.

Today I decided to boil it. First, I took a medium sized pot out of the cupboard and filled it with water from the sink. Then I placed the pot on a burner on the stove and turned the heat on high. Once the water began to boil, I placed the hot dog in the water. While the hot dog was cooking, I toasted a bun in the toaster oven.

I found the dewey decimal code for the book I wanted , and set off through the aisles . Finally , I found the aisle I was looking for . It only took me a moment from there to find the book I wanted . Book in hand , I went back to the library counter . I told the librarian I 'd like to borrow the book . She wrote my information down and on the insert in the book , and gave me a due date .

As that was heating up, I went to the refrigerator, opened it, and took out the gallon of milk. I poured about a cup of milk into the saucepan that was heating on the stove. I opened the refrigerator to put the milk back inside as I waited for the milk on the stove to heat to a boiling temperature. In order to keep the milk from becoming scorched, I use a wooden spatula to gently stir the milk as the steam began to rise. In order to keep the milk from boiling over, once I saw that Steve was rising from the milk, I lower the heat to a medium temperature, but only for a minute. After the minute was over, I turned the heat completely off. I put a lid on top of the saucepan to cover the milk, and a loud it to sits for another minute before I poured the milk into our cups to make the hot chocolate.\n",

It can be a lot of fun to sit around a bonfire, especially with friends. I think of what we will need to make one. We will have to have things to burn. Wood is very good to burn, and is the only thing that should be used for fire. A bonfire is big, so we will need a lot of wood. It's hard to light big pieces of wood on fire, so we will need smaller pieces. The smaller pieces of wood are easy to light on fire, but bigger pieces burn longer. So, we will need both big and small pieces of wood. We gather the wood and stack the pieces of wood on top of each other. The small pieces are under the big pieces, so the fire starts easier. We light the small pieces on fire, which catches the big pieces on fire after a while. My friends and I watch the fire burn while staying far enough away from it to be safe.\n",

They invite us over so that we can visit with each other and exchange gifts and talk about Jesus.  I loaded up my daughter into the car this past year and drove to their house.

She loves Italian food and her favorite of all is Milano'S Grill. I looked up in the yellow pages the number for Milano's Grill. I took out my phone and dialed the number. It rang three times before a hostess answered. I said that I wanted to make a reservation for that Thursday night at 8pm. I specified a table for two by the window. She informed that they only had an opening by the window at 8:30 pm or 7 pm on Thursday. I said I would take the 7 pm opening in that case and gave my name in order to hold the reservation. She thanked me and said they were looking forward to serving us on Thursday night. I hung up as the call was now completed. I also marked the time and date of this reservation on my calendar.\n",

I prefer to use free-range, organic eggs. Sometimes I buy eggs from a local farmer. They are very tasty and the yolks are often a dark orange color. I tap the eggs against the edge of a bowl and let the yolks and whites slide into the bowl.. I discard the shells. Then I add a little milk and some herbs, along with salt and pepper, and I beat the eggs with a whisk. I heat a pan and add a little butter. When the butter is melted, I add the egg mixture to the pan. As the eggs cook, I move them around the pan with a spatula. This makes the eggs become fluffy. Sometimes I sprinkle a little cheese on top. When the eggs are finished, I scoop them out onto a plate.\n",

We got our swimsuits on and grabbed towels from the closet.  Swimming always makes us hungry, so we packed a small cooler with some snacks and bottled water.  We also remembered to bring the sunscreen.  We put everything in the car, and drove across town to the public swimming pool.  We paid the admission fee, then walked into the locker rooms and took a quick shower before getting into the pool.  That's one of the rules at the public pool.  After the shower, we walked into the pool area and found a nice spot to put our towels and cooler.  We put on sunscreen to prevent sunburn, then we were ready for the pool!  When we got in, the water felt really cold, but after we had swum around for a while, it felt refreshing.  It was a great day for a swim!\n",

Place the pieces in the toaster with one piece per slot. Keep in mind there are several different settings on the toasted. The higher the number the more toasted the bread will be. Keep it at a medium setting to have  a good toast. With this toast you can do a lot with it. Once it is done it will pop from the toaster and you can immediately put butter on the bread so the butter will melt it. You can make a toasted sandwich with the bread. You can put jam on it, jelly on it, anything you want. Once you are done with the toaster be sure the toaster is in the off position so it does not burn the house down.\n",

I chose to walk to the right, where there were dinosaurs.  Big statues of T Rex and Stegosaurus were standing tall in the room, and I took some pictures with my camera.  I walked through the exhibit and went into the art room.  There were paintings and photographs and different sculptures.  Many different colors were on the wall, and I took some more photos.

However, after September 11th, 2001, that seemed like the one thing I really looked forward to doing in the morning. I knew the events that happened the day before and their impact on the world would be heard fast and impactful. The newspaper was the quickest way to get a real feeling for how it would be felt and how the reactions would be coming in. This event also experienced some of the best graphic design work ever done - especially in comparison to the old newspapers that ran historic events like the JFK assassination and whatnot. After getting the newspaper, I sat at the kitchen table with my cup of coffee and read the entire paper from front cover to back page, word for word. That may be the only time that I had ever done that and the most memorable time that I've ever read the newspaper.\n",

Then I put a pan on the stove and sprayed vegetable oil in the pan to keep the eggs from sticking.   I turned on the stove and waited a minute for the pan to get hot.  I poured the egg mixture into pan.  I added the chopped onions and peppers.  I made sure to stir as I cooked so the eggs cooked evenly.  When the eggs were cooked I added graded cheese.  The warmth of the eggs melted the cheese.  I ate the eggs with my daughter.  She liked them but did not like the onions and peppers.

I have a Golden Retriever, and her name is Stella. She is four years old and loves going on walks. I grab her leash and attach it to her collar. I take a back pack with me, which I carry my phone in, alongside a second leash, doggie doo doo bags to pick up after Stella if she decides to use the restroom and a water bottle. We walk all throughout my neighborhood and some days I even take her on a walk through the green ways which she loves. We stick to the sidewalk, and if she needs to take a rest she sits down on the sidewalk and we wait for a few minutes, and continue. I love taking Stella on walks, except she sometimes barks at squirrels because she is scared of them. I eventually have to walk home with her, and get ready for bed and eat dinner though, but I love taking Stella on walks.\n",

I prepare about 6-8 bottles ahead of time and place in the refrigerator so the baby doesn't have to wait long for food when hungry. I take the bottle, cold and wet feeling, placing it under hot tap water for 30 seconds. I can control the temperature and it is safer than microwaving for the baby. After testing a drop or two of warmed formula on my wrist, to make sure it isn't too cold or hot, it is time to pick up the baby and feed them. I hold the baby in my arms as they longingly look into my eyes. I talk to the baby and even sing, although my singing isn't the best. After about fifteen minutes the baby isn't drinking anymore. I put them over my shoulder and rub their back in order for them to burp. I then prop them up in their baby seat so as not to choke. I sit them in the kitchen with me as I clean the bottle.\n",

I got online and looked at the different restaurants in the area, and selected a nice Italian restaurant in the city. I found the number on their webpage, and called the number that was listed. When the person on the other end answered, I explained that I was trying to make dinner reservations approximately 30 days in the future. The person who answered, a man, asked me how big of a party did I need to be accommodate.  The surprise dinner was for my parents, and my sister, older brother and I all planned to attend. So, I told the man on the phone that I needed to seat five people. The man then asked me what time would I be arriving at the restaurant. I told the man that we would like to come in and eat around 6 o'clock.  He then confirmed the date and time with me one last time, and asked me for my phone number and first and last name. After confirming the date and giving the man my information, he thanked me for my reservation and wished me a good day. I then hung up the phone.\n",

I log on to each website and enter my information. After I do this I can see my account and how much I owe to the company. I enter in my payment information and click submit.

I got out of bed and put  my robe on over my pajamas, so I would not be cold when I went out side in to the morning air. When I walked out of my door I saw that the paper was not on my walk was as it usually was. I had to walk farther down the drive way to pick the newspaper up. When I walked to where the newspaper was, I bent down to pick it up. Once I had it in my hand, I walked back inside of my door. When I was inside I went to the kitchen table. I opened the paper to my favorite section and started to read it. I was very happy to read the newspaper.\n",

If it's cold I wait by the door but if the weather is nice, I go out with her.  She will walk around and sniff the yard to see if other dogs have been there.  After she sniffs around for a while, she will finally go to the bathroom.  Sometimes she will try to chase a squirrel.  If there is a rabbit nearby they will have a stand off and the rabbit usually wins.  My dog will go somewhere else in the yard and leave the rabbit alone.  Then she comes back to the door and we go inside.  Once we are inside, she expects for me to give her a snack which I do.\n",

Mother's milk usually comes from the baby's mother and would be prepared by her ahead of time.  Here is how I feed a baby.  First I place the mother's milk in a bottle, or I mix the dry formula and water being careful to measure the correct amounts of both in the baby bottle stirring until the powder is completely dissolved.  Then I place the bottle in a pan of water on the stove and warm it until it feels just slightly warm.  Not too hot and not too cold.  When the milk is ready, I hold the baby with one arm and hold the baby's bottle with the other hand and let the baby drink.   It is important to hold the bottle upright so the baby does not swallow air.  When the baby is finished drinking help her burp.  I put a cloth on my shoulder and hold the baby against my shoulder, and gently pat her back until she burps.  When she burps she usually spits up a little milk which is caught by the cloth.  Now the baby will usually want to sleep.\n",

I decided to open the window to let in some fresh air.  Then started to clean the tub and the sink.  The last plumbing item I cleaned was the toilet.  I scrubbed the outside and then the bowl.  Everything was sparkling clean.  Now it was time to mop the floor.  I filled a bucket with cleaner and mopped the floor.  After it dried, I wiped down the mirrors and windows.  It smelled so fresh and clean!  I changed out the trash bag and closed the window.  I made sure all the linens were clean and changed and then I took down the shower curtain.

I got dressed and made a cup of coffee before I decided to get the paper. I grabbed my car keys, went outside and got into my car. I drove my car up to the gas station about 1 mile from my house where they have a news paper box. I got out of the car and walked up to the newspaper box and made sure it was today's paper by looking at the one placed against the glass window. To get the paper, I had to place $1.00 in quarters into the coin slot at the top of the newspaper box. Once I put the coins in, I pulled the handle on the box and reached in to grab my newspaper.

A bonus is that a lovely warm scent often rises up off whatever item I am ironing as I press it flat and smooth. I set up my ironing board before I begin. Then I plug in and turn on my iron, usually filling it with water before I do, and setting it to the highest temperature that matches the fabric I'm ironing first. Cottons need more heat than synthetics. Then I organize the things I plan to iron in a basket. I put simple items on the bottom, and more complicated things like shirts and blouses on top, and do them first. It doesn't take much time to organize the wash before I begin, and saves work in the end. I start ironing a shirt or blouse at the collar, ironing it flat, and then turning it over to iron the other side. Then I do the cuffs, if any, and the decorations, if any. Then I hang the garment up, so it won't wrinkle again, and go on to the next.\n",

Later that week I was interviewed to work in the dining room as an assistant helper. My first task was to set up a small dining table which was an new experience to me. My first night I had everything backward and completely wrong.  The next day I showed up for work determining to do the job right, because I really needed the money as a high school senior. I was successful in setting the small dining table. Shortly after, a family of of twelve made reservation and I was put on the spot to set up the dining room table.

I started by bringing in my change of clothes, as it is always more convenient to change after the shower than it is to walk all the way over to my room to do it. I tend to let the shower water run first so that it can heat up, and I spend that time brushing my teeth. Once I'm done, I place my towel at the end of the shower opposite of the shower head. Typically, I'll stay under the hot water for quite a few minutes, as a shower is really my only means of relaxation. After that, I'll use some shampoo on my hair and let that wash away. Sometimes I'll use soap, but soap is something that isn't as necessary as people think it is, so I try not to use that too often. And after a lengthy amount of time rinsing off, I simply allow myself to stand there after turning the shower water off, thinking about the day ahead of me and whatever other thoughts ran through my mind during the shower. And then, I get out of the shower, dry off, and get dressed.\n",

I chose beef, and carrots, and a custard for dessert. I put a little apple juice it the spill proof glass. Then, I put the beef and carrots on a little plate and heated them slightly in the microwave. Then I picked up my little baby girl, and put her in the high chair, put the tray in place, and fastened her bib in place. After that, I brought the food over, sat down in the other chair, and began feeding her. She was pretty hungry, and the foods I chose were her favorites, so she was ready for the next bite before I even had the spoon ready. She finished her meal quickly. I cleaned her up with a damp washcloth and put her down for her nap.\n",

We got dressed in our swimsuits at her house, and then we put on our street clothes over them. We wanted to save time at the pool. It's only two blocks away, and we wore our flip-flops to walk there. We kept them on when we took cool showers in the changing room too. When we came out we spread out our beach towels in the shade, and put on our sunblock. My friend has long hair, so she put on a bathing cap to keep it out of her eyes. We talked for a while, until we felt so warm we needed to go in the water. Then we dove in and raced each other across the shallow end. She is a little bit faster than I am, but I'm learning.\n",

I like reading so much that my Mom asked the librarian to give me an adult library card so I could check out more books . The kids card only allows you to check out two books a week , and only from the children 's room . The adult card gives me all access -LRB- at the librarian 's discretion my mom said -RRB- and six books a week ! When I get to the library I like to browse the new releases shelves . Sometimes I ask the librarian for a suggestion . If I have a specific topic I want to read I might do a search on the computer .

Once you have figured out what you have to clean and how you are going to accomplish it, it is important to gather  the necessary equipment to clean with. Once you have done this, you should start to complete the chore in whatever fashion that you feel is most appropriate. You can do this by going in one direction or by following whatever manner that you wish. You may want to use a vacuum to clean up dust or anything else that may be in your way. You also most likely want to have something to store the toys that you are cleaning so that they do not wind up back all over the floor. If you are able to do this, you should be well prepared to clean efficiently and effectively.\n",

I took it down to the kitchen and put it on the counter. I took bread out of the bag and stacked it on a plate, and got the meat and cheese out of the refrigerator along with mayo and mustard. After putting all the ingredients on the counter, I made two sandwiches for everyone going out to the lake today. Putting them in the huge basket, I added a bag of chips. The basket still seemed to be missing something. I put away all the stuff for sandwiches, and started looking through the drawers of produce. Fruit would be a nice addition to this picnic, I thought to myself. I added a bag of pears and a bag of apples to the sandwiches and chips. The basket was now a lot heavier, and ready to go. Loading it in the car, I was excited to see all my friends at the lake, and to share my lunch with them.\n",

I did this so many times for her! I was a good sister!  For her baby Anna, I always laid her down on a cloth or towel, or even better a table that is just for changing babies.  I unsnapped her clothes and unfastened the diaper.  I took the diaper off and it was a little messy.  Then I took some baby wipes, and wiped the baby down so that there was no more mess on the baby.  Then I put baby powder or sometimes ointment if Anna had a rash, to help the baby rash. Then I slid the clean diaper under the baby's bottom.

Then I headed out the door to pick up my friends. We had decided I would drive since it was my idea. It seemed fair. I picked up my friends one by one and we were en route to the beach. Once there we set up everything from the beach towels to the snacks and drinks. We made sure to wear sunscreen and we had plenty of fun. It was the best beach party ever.\n",

Bobby suggests going to the arcade, but Jimmy says, \"Let's go to the shopping centre.\" The rest of the boys agree, and they head over to the shopping centre that is 2 blocks away from the school. Bobby really wanted to go to the arcade, but decides to tag along with his friends to the shopping centre instead. The boys finally approach the stores and roam around wondering what new clothes they can buy. Most of the items in the store were really expensive. Bobby only saved up to 50 dollars from the amount of chores he did last month, so he didn't have much to spend. Bobby suggests that they go to the food court to get some food before they start wandering around. Everyone agrees and they all go marching onto the food court to get some yummy food.\n",

I did not, so I called the nearest restaurant that delivers pizza.  I told the woman on the line that I wanted a pizza with pepperoni and black olives.  She asked me what size pizza I wanted.  I ordered a large, so that I could have leftovers for another couple meals.  The woman asked for my address, and asked me to confirm my phone number so they could call when the pizza was ready.  She then told me the pizza would be ready in around half an hour.  I thanked her and hung up the phone.  I read a book while I waited for the pizza to arrive.  After around half an hour, I heard a knock at my front door.  I came to the door, and a man stood there holding a pizza box.  I paid for the pizza, and tipped the delivery person.

I made reservations at a nice Italian restaurant.  I took extra care in getting ready and picked her up at 6:30 for our 7:00 reservation.  She looked amazing, wearing a pretty pink and white dress with a halter top and white sandals.  I parked the car and we went inside.  We were seated immediately and I asked her if she would like to split a bottle of wine.  She said yes and we agreed on a red wine.  The waiter served us while we looked at the menu.  We ordered and had a really nice conversation while waiting for our food.  It felt very comfortable and we got to know more about one another.  The evening flew by!  It was a warm night, so after dinner we went to a local park and sat on a bench looking at the stars and talking some more.  We agreed then that we would like to go out on another date soon.

As I got closer, I found out that the person was actually putting newspapers into a dispenser.  I told him that I would really like one.  He told me that I would need to pay 50 cents to buy the newspaper, and only after he was done.  So I waited a few minutes for him to finish stocking up the newspaper display case and then I was ready to buy them.  I got out my money in a form of a couple quarters and I put them in the little slot to put money in.

We all agreed that we wanted to learn a new kind of dance. We settled on learning salsa at a local dance studio in our neighborhood. We called the studio and asked if we could sign up to take a salsa class together. The studio let us know the price of the class, which we agreed to pay. We then went to the studio together and rented special shoes that we needed to wear to salsa dance in. The studio also had fancy dresses that women could rent for the dance class. Traditional salsa dancers wear fancy clothing when they dance sometimes, so my friends and I decided to rent those dresses. Our instructor taught us all kinds of new salsa dances yesterday.

I invited 20 people from our neighborhood to attend this birthday party. My son had also invited 5 of his friends from school to attend. The party was scheduled to start at 3:00pm. There was going to be a magic show at 4:00pm. My son was always fascinated by magic tricks. The party was held in our backyard which had a lot of room. For outdoor activities I bought a mini pool, a blow up playhouse, and a cotton candy station. All of the children who attended enjoyed making their own cotton candy. There was food, drinks, candy, and a giant cake to conclude the party. Also, I sent everyone home with a doggie bag of candy of a small toy to remind them of their attendance. Every one enjoyed themselves and the magician did a fantastic job.\n",

Early in the morning I got up and had breakfast with my family, my dad was very quiet, eating at the table and staring out the window. He was visibly sad even though my grandma, his mom, had been sick for many years and her passing away was expected.  However, death is never easy. After breakfast, we all left to get showered and dressed for the funeral. As it is custom to do, we all wore solid black attire: black clothes from head to toe. I wore a black dress, black stockings, and a black blazer with black heels. After everyone was dressed and ready to go, we got in the car, and drove over to the church. Many people came up to us at the funeral ceremony to give us their condolences, they were truly sorry for our loss. The preacher gave a touching sermon about God and his plan for all of us in this lifetime, and gave thanks to God for Rose Elizabeth's life, and her many achievements. At the end of the ceremony, we all walked out to the church's cemetery and said our goodbyes to our grandmother for the last time as we watched as her casket was closed and lowered down into the ground.  We watched as flowers were placed on the grave. We then left to go home and be together as a family and support each other through the sad time of our grandmother's passing.\n",

My friend warned me that her daughter was having some stomach issues but told me where the medicine was in case the daughter needed any while I was with her. My friend left and I began playing with her daughter. After a while, it was time for dinner so I cooked the daughter some macaroni and cheese with apple slices. She seemed hungry and was eating most of her dinner. However, about half an hour after she'd finished, she started complaining that her stomach hurt. I decided that since her stomach was hurting I would give her the medicine my friend had left for me. The medicine was a very thick pink liquid designed for kids, so I was hoping that her daughter would eat it easily. She was upset at first and said she didn't want to eat the yucky stuff, but I promised her that it would make her stomach feel better. We counted down from three and she swallowed a whole spoonful of the medicine. I gave her a high five for being brave, and about twenty minutes later her stomach felt better again.\n",

I set most of my bills so that they are paid automatically.  When I moved to my apartment, I sent information for my bank account to the electric company and the cable company.  I can't pay my water bill automatically.  Once a month, I get a bill in the mail.  I got my water bill last Thursday.  I opened the letter and see how much money I owed.  Then I got out my checkbook, and wrote a check for that amount.  I made sure to write my address in the memo line and \"water bill\" so that the people at the water company know what the check is for.  I put the check in an envelope, and addressed it to the water company.  I also put my own address in the top left corner, and a stamp in the top right.  I walked to my mailbox and sent the envelope.

This means that the carpet often gets covered with cat hair, as well as little pieces of litter that get stuck to the cats' paws when they use the litter box. I got the vacuum out of its storage place in the front closet. I unraveled the cord and plugged the vacuum into the nearest outlet. I then turned the vacuum on and vacuumed the carpet. I had to go over some places a few times in order for the vacuum to suck up all of the cat hair and loose pieces of litter, along with any other dirt and debris. Once the carpet was visibly cleaner, I unplugged the vacuum and put it away in the closet.\n",

He put in a little salt so the pasta would not stick together and added a box of bowtie pasta. He stirred it occasionally to ensure that the pasta cooked evenly and did not stick together. The water kept boiling for about ten minutes and then he checked it every minute or so to see when the texture was not too soft and not too hard. He drained it and dumped it into a bowl. He used a jar of pre-made creamy garlic sauce which he heated up in the microwave and dumped onto the pasta and mixed it together. To serve the pasta he put it in individual bowls and sprinkled them with some Parmesan cheese and fresh basil. He also toasted up some garlic bread.\n",

First, I went to the closet where we keep the box of garbage bags. I opened the box, took out a garbage bag, and placed it in the pocket of my pants so I would have it handy for later. Then I walked over to the kitchen trash can and opened the lid. I grabbed the garbage bag by taking the drawstrings on each side and tying them into a knot. I lifted the garbage bag out of the trash can by pulling the drawstrings, and placed the bag on the floor. Next, I took the empty garbage bag out of my pocket. I unfolded the bag, placed it into the trashcan, and stretched it around the rim. When I was finished, I closed the lid.

You can do that in person, too, but it's so much easier to do it online. A few days before the trip, we packed up all our stuff. Then we went to the store and got all of the groceries we needed. When the big day finally came, we were already prepared. We put everything in the car. Then we drove to the park. It was still light out when we got to our spot. All we had to do was set up. We pitched the tent and put away all our things. Most of the food stayed in the car so animals wouldn't get it. We only took out what we needed to make dinner.

We took our measurements to the store and picked out a pretty pattern for the tile.  We bought the tile and brought it home.  Next, we had to remove the old floor.  We pried up the linoleum around the edges.  It was stuck down with glue, so this was a difficult job.  We also had to move the refrigerator and stove out of the way in order to get the old linoleum out. When the old floor was out of the way, we vacuumed the sub-floor underneath.  Then, we started gluing down our new floor tiles, starting in the middle of the room and working outward.  When we got to the edges of the room, we had to cut some of the tiles to fit.

We go into the woods and look for limbs that have fallen to the ground.  Our favorite wood to get is dry and burns easily. Luckily, today Jon has brought  a chainsaw along and will help me chop up the larger wood we find.  Once we have found the wood, We drag it out of the forest and placed it in a pile close to where we will be building a bonfire.  When I selected a place for the bonfire, I made sure that there was nothing close that could catch fire. I used a rake to remove all of the dry leaves or grass that could catch fire and spread somewhere else.   We normally keep a garden hose close by, just in case the bonfire gets out of control.   Jon starts gathering small pieces of wood to start the fire.  He uses some dry pine straw from the edge of the forest to add to the small pile.  He light a match and ignites the pine straw and small pieces.   The flame takes hold of the small dry pile of wood, and we both start adding larger pieces to the pile.  We are very careful to add them in teepee pattern to allow air underneath the limbs and to keep from smothering the small fire that Jon had started.  It doesn't take long for the larger limbs to start to catch and before you know it Jon and I have a huge bonfire perfect for s'mores and camp fire songs.\n",

There are usually many different types of stores at a shopping centre, like grocery stores, restaurants, clothing or shoe stores, hair salons, greeting card stores, pet stores, sporting goods stores, drug stores, or banks. You can drive to the shopping centre, park your car in the parking lot, and walk to all of the stores, which are usually not very far apart. This is a good way to get many different errands done in a short amount of time, since all of the stores are located at the same place.

Since there was a large group of us we thought it would be a good idea to call ahead and make a reservation. I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager that we would have a large group and wanted to make a reservation in the back room for 6:00 on Friday night. The manager was very helpful and offered to provide a cake that they would decorate with his name. I told him to put the reservation under my name and our party would give that when they arrive. I asked if it was possible to have the table ready by 5:45 so everyone could get there a little before my boyfriend and I and they could surprise him by all being seated.

I put on shoes and my glasses (sunglasses if it's sunny) and gather up the other things I need where I'm going. Next, I go into the garage and open the garage door. I check around the car to make sure I won't run over anything as I back out. Then I unlock the driver's door and get in. After I put the key in the lock, I fasten my seat belt, adjust the rear view mirrors and secure any loose objects around me.  I start the engine and back the car out of the garage, watching for people walking and other cars and signaling which way I'm turning. Once I'm on my way, I turn on the radio and listen to music or the news while I'm driving. As I drive toward my destination, I watch other cars carefully and obey all traffic signals and signs, careful to slow down at intersections if the light is already green before I get there. I make sure I come to a full stop at stop signs and stop lights. When I turn, I signal well in advance, and I stay in the correct lanes, middle and center, unless I know I'm going to turn, and then I stay in the far right-hand lane. When I reach my destination, I signal the last turn, and park the car in a legal parking space. Before I get out, I turn off the car, gather up what I need, put up sun blinds if I need to, turn off the radio and take the key. I double check to make sure I've locked all the doors and the trunk before I walk away.\n",

A friend of ours drops us off at the airport near the sign that has our airline service on it.  We take our luggage to the curbside check in station.  There we show the attendant our tickets in order to let the airline know that we have arrived at the airport for our flight.  We hand over our larger suitcases that will be stored in the cargo area of the plane during the flight.    My husband's suitcase is a little heavy, so the attendant weighs it to make sure it's not over the 50lb limit that my airline requires.  Once our bags were checked, the attendant put a tag on them indicated which flight they will be going on.  After we have checked in, we take our carry on bags and tickets and head to the security station.  When we arrived at the security station, we stood in a long line and show a TSA agent our drivers license.  Then we removed our shoes and put them along with the items in our pockets in a plastic tub.  We placed the tub and our carry on luggage on a table that x-rays your luggage to make sure you are not carrying anything dangerous on the plane.  We also had to go through a metal detector.  Once we were done we headed to the gate where our plane would be leaving.  We were so excited to be checked in to for our flight and ready to leave for our vacation.\n",

I wait to go shopping usually until Thursday or Friday so that I can use the weekly ads to make my list . I shop for items on sale , so I like to be very prepared . I also use the store 's apps on my phone to track what deals they are offering for me this week . I plan out my list based on the ads and the apps , and write each store 's name above the items I want to buy there .

I arrived just before dark so I had to hurry to get things set up. first I unpacked my tent and laid out all the poles. Then I set up the tent and put my sleeping bag inside. As the last light of the day began to fade I hurried and gathered wood for a fire. I set up a fire pit surrounded by rocks. I used dry leaves to get the fire started. I had a lighter so I didn't need to resort to any slamming of rocks or rubbing of sticks. Once the fire was nice and big I made a dinner of hotdogs and marshmallows.

Once I found the spot that would cover the whole room, I plugged it in and got started. The vacuum roared as I swept over the dirty spots on the floor. I have always loved how well my vacuum works. It picked up all the crumbs instantly. I got into a groove and was going over the carpet real well. I got the hose out to cover the tricky spots on the floor.

I got out  the eggs and salt and milk and started to mix them all up in a glass bowl.  I used a whisk and that really made sure that they were fluffy.  When the mixing was done, I got out a pan and placed it on the burner.  I turned the heat on and it started to get hot.  I threw the mixture on the pan and started to swirl it around and make it cook.  When one side was done, I flipped it over to form a omelette shape.  When it was done cooking, I got out a plate and put it on there so that she could eat it in her bed.\n",

Then they take shampoo and put a little bit in the hand, then rub it all over their hair. Then they wait a few seconds or a few minutes and rub the scalp as well to make sure they get rid of dandruff - some kind of dead skin. If the shampoo doesn't make much foam, it means the hair is still dirty. So they put another dose of shampoo in the hand and wash their hair again. Shampoo cannot go in the eyes because it might burn. After the shampoo is on the head, and it has been rubbed in to clean the scalp, the most important thing is to rinse it with lots of clear warm water. To avoid getting sick, it is important to dry the hair. The easiest way is to rub it with a dry towel, but some people like to use a hairdryer. Once the hair is dry, it can be combed any way the person likes, but it is important to avoid putting styling gels and other chemical on it too often to keep it healthy.\n",

When I flipped the switch, though, the light did not turn on and I realized that the light bulb had burned out. I went to the store to get a replacement bulb. It took me a few minutes to find a bulb with the right wattage, but I found a package of four of them. I paid for them and took them home. I made sure the light was switched off before I unscrewed the old light bulb.

The crisp scent of new sheets filled my room with a nice smell. I shook all the wrinkles out, and pulled the old sheets and pillow cases off my bed. After taking them in to the laundry room and putting them in the washer, I decided to take the vacuum into my room with me to tidy up after I made the bed. The new sheets matched the wall paper my friend Mike had just helped me put on the walls. The dark grey and soothing white made me feel better just seeing it. I love my room, and was excited to see how the new sheets looked. I put the fitted sheet on first and made sure all four corners were tucked under to hold it down. Next, I put the flat sheet on top of the filled one. I tucked just the bottom under the mattress so I could still fold the top down when I was done. Then, I put my comforter on top of the flat sheet. I smoothed all the wrinkles out, and put the pillow cases on all four of my pillows. Putting the pillows up against the headboard in a decorative fashion made my bed look great!

I swept all the dust and bits of loose dirt into the dust pan and emptied it into the garbage can.  Next, I went back to the closet and got out a bucket, a mop, and a bottle of floor cleaner.  I put the bucket in the bathtub and poured a little of the cleaner into it, then filled it with warm water.  Starting in one corner of the kitchen, I began to mop.  I soaked the mop in the cleaning solution, wrung it out, and swirled it around on the floor.  I pushed the mop vigorously back and forth, dunking it back into the bucket every few swipes.  I worked my way across the kitchen until the whole floor had been mopped.  Then I let the floor dry.\n",

As a result, I volunteered to go downstairs and get the coffee. I first went downstairs and got the coffee packet and then started the Keurig. After staring the Keurig, I put the water in and began to make my coffee with the packet.

We had a fire pit in our backyard already, so now all we needed was firewood. This wasn't hard to find, because all we needed to do was go to the nearest grocery store where they sold fire logs. After getting the firewood, we needed to make sure we had enough things to throw into the fire to keep it burning. We used whatever old newspapers and junk paper we could find in our house. After we got everything together one night, my family went outside to the fire pit and we lit some logs on fire.

When you went to Blockbuster, there were several shelves of movies, sorted by what type of movie they were.  I remember checking out one movie frequently as a kid, called The Iron Giant.  I walked to the shelf with the animated movies, and searched back and forth until I found the right film.  Then I went to the cashier, and gave them some money to check out the movie.  It was sort of like going to the library.  I put the movie in my bag, got on my bike, and excitedly rode home to watch the film.  I had a lot of fun watching it.

Most people’s water is hard. You can tell if you have hard water or not by the way the soap doesn’t suds up. In soft water, soap suds  up and it doesn’t stick so bad to the walls. Can never really clean it unless use chemicals to break up the soap scum. Even with the cleaner called “BlastOff” it doesn’t fully remove it unless use the white Mr. Clean sponge in tandem with BlastOff. The white sponges do not last very long.  The white sponge with the BlastOff spray works better than the pumice that is used by scraping the tiles.  Unless it iodine stains – then have to use something completely different and I forgot the name of the brand that removes iodine. Removing iodine stains by spraying and leaving there over night, it will be gone, but only in the places where it dripped down and have to use the entire bottle all at once.\n",

I found a shovel and a watering can . With my seeds and tools , I found a spot in my yard that looked like it would get enough sunshine . There , I dug a hole for the seeds . I put a few in , and covered dirt back on top . After that I patted the the mound of earth back down . Once that was done , I took my watering can and watered the seeds until the soil was fairly moist . After that , I went to put away gardening supplies . I planned to water my tree periodically .

Today, I'm going to boil them in water. Once the hot dogs are cooked, I take a hot dog and put it in a bun. Now it's time to choose the toppings. There's no limit to what you can put on a hot dog! You can put on ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, chili, cheese - the choices are endless! But for today, I'm going to put on good old ketchup and mustard. Now it's time to eat!

The best direction generally depends primarily on the shape of the house; it should run parallel to the longer walls. This isn't a dictum, though. If you have a long, prominent hallway, you may choose to run the flooring parallel to its walls, even if that means it will run parallel to the short walls in the living room. It's also important to consider the sightline from the entry; lines running parallel to the sightline are more visually pleasing than those running across it. I tried my best to follow direction given. Some time I could not do it good, so I had to redo again.I took the first, full length plank with the tongue removed and position it on the floor with the groove facing in. Then the first piece of the second row that I cut in half and lay it next to the first plank. Snapped the tongue of this piece into the groove of the first piece. Snapped the next two planks into the ends of the first two. I Continued until I reach the end of the row, place a 2-inch spacer against the wall and measure and cut the last plank to fit in the gap. I Slide the completed two rows into place against the wall using a hammer and block. Continue assembling rows across the room.\n",

We purchased our tickets at the movie theatre, through the desk window at the entrance and payed in cash for matinee tickets. Once we got our tickets, we went inside and then got food from the concession stand. We got a big Pepsi, and then a large popcorn which we shared. We also got some Twizzlers to share. We then got in line, and they checked our ticket then directed us to our theatre where our movie was playing. Once we got there, we found seats and sat and watched the movie.

The first thing we had to do was put on our bathing suits, and then we had to find some large towels to take with us. We then put sunblock on all of our body and face so we do not get sunburned. Once we have our towels and sunblock, we make sure we have a pass so that we may enter the pool. We also decide take an inner tube and leave to go out the door. We walk down to the pool and enter through the gate. A young man checks our pool pass and admits us to the pool. We find two chairs so we can put our towels down. After settling our items, we walk down to the edge of the pool on the shallow end. We sit on the edge and carefully dip our toes into the freezing water and slowly slide into the pool. We are able to splash around and swim until the lifeguard signals for us to leave the pool so that children may enter. We return to our towels so we can dry off and stay warm.\n",

Finally, I picked up each toy that was still left on the floor and put it in its proper spot, such as on my bed or in a dresser drawer or even in my closet.

The top six players played singles tennis (1 on 1), the rest of us played doubles (2 on 2). Each match lasted six sets, or more because the winning team had to win by two sets. A set is scored differently than in most games. Instead of counting by 1, 2, 3, a tennis set is scored by love (0), 15, 30, 40, and match point. Singles tennis uses the narrow boundaries of the court, and doubles used the wider section. I really enjoyed playing, even though I wasn't the best player.

Next, we had to plan the decoration and food. So we went to the dollar store many times, and also Costco to buy the tableware, food, and decor. We also bought some alcohol. We then invited people on Facebook and through texting. We then had to follow up and see if the people would actually come.

I like it to look pretty, so I will begin by folding a cloth napkin and place it on our beige place mats we normally have at the dining room table. Since my son is still a toddler, he eats in his high chair and doesn't require anything fancy, so I just put together two settings. Since I cooked a nice steak for dinner tonight, I found and washed a couple of our good wood handled steak knives and placed those on the right of the plate I took from the cabinet. On the left, just a fork, since I didn't make a salad, and a water glass in the upper right corner. I worked fine dining throughout my twenties, so I like my table to be set properly.

I took it to Grandma and asked her what to do. \"Give that to me, child,\" she said, \"and we will fix it together.\" We walked to her sewing room, where she keeps all kinds of colorful pieces of fabric, thread, and buttons. \"There's a spool of blue thread in there that matches the color of your sweater. Bring it to me.\" I found it quickly and walked to Grandma's favorite chair. She had her sewing box open, and I could see all kinds of needles, a pair of scissors, and even a little red pincushion with dozens of pins stuck in it. She cut a length of blue thread and handed me a needle. \"Push the end of the thread through that little hole in the needle for Grandma. These old eyes aren't what they used to be,\" she said. I did so and handed it back to her. She tied a knot in the bottom of the long piece of thread, and said, \"Now watch carefully, child, and you will know how to fix it yourself next time.\" She poked the needle through the holes in the button and through the sweater at the same time, crisscrossing the thread as she went. Then she tied a knot in the thread under the button and cut off the remaining thread. \"There, child, good as new,\" she said. \"Thank you, Grandma!\" I said. \"That was fast. Maybe someday I can fix the button on your sweater.\" She smiled, gave me a cookie, and sent me out to play.\n",

I woke my husband and our son and we made plans to travel back to Utah to attend services for my grandfather and to be with my mother in this trying time. By the time I had returned to Utah (less than 48 hours) my mother had arrangements made and we knew that his services would be held in two days.  My son was very well behaved in my mothers home, sensing something was wrong, but being too young to grasp what was going on.  The day of the funeral came and I helped my mother get ready and she helped me.  My husband tended to my son and got him ready.  We went to the church where my grandfathers body was in an open casket.  He really looked wonderful.  The service was not long and then we buried him at the cemetery where my grandmother and another uncle were also buried.

At first, I didn't know how I was going to eat all of those oranges.  But I thought hard about it and we decided to make fresh orange juice.  I cut up the oranges with a knife and made sure that the peels were no longer on the oranges.  We washed the pieces and put them into a juicer.  The juice came out and it was really thick and sour, so we decided to add some water to make it thinner and sugar to make it sweeter.

I also bought a pink bow and a card.  The night before her birthday, I wrapped the present.  First, I made sure that I picked a workspace that was big enough.  I used the kitchen table.  Next, I rolled out the wrapping paper.  I made sure that I had enough paper to go all the way around the gift and left a little extra room on the ends.  Then, I cut the paper.  Once the paper was cut to the right size, I placed the gift in the middle.  I wrapped the paper from the long side of the box up to the middle of my package.  I pulled both sides tight so that the paper was very smooth and I taped it closed.  Next I closed the ends by folding up the ends and taping them.  After the gift was all covered with the paper, I put the bow right in the middle on the top of the gift and taped the card to it.  The gift looked so beautiful when I finished wrapping it.\n",

I made sure I took out all the trash, went back inside, and proceeded to vacuum my entire house.  I made sure the bed was made in my guest room, and that there was clean sheets and towels for my friend.  Then, I went back down to my kitchen and mopped the floor.  It was a good thing I did because it was a total mess.  The last thing I had left to do was two weeks worth of laundry.  While I was working on that I decided to get out my recipe for French apple pie and make a homemade pie since I had some yummy vanilla ice cream to go with it.

She has some watermelons too, so I help her to weed the garden on occasion.  We had a great time laughing and talking about our week while we did our work in her garden.  It is very relaxing to work in a garden and plant and tend the plants.  By the time we finished weeding out all the weeds that had grown from so much rain that month, we were very thirsty.

To make scrambled eggs you need to crack two eggs and put them into a bowl.  Then you add a little bit of milk and you mix the eggs and milk together.  The next step is to take a small frying plan and either spray it with a cooking spray or melt some butter in the plan.  Once the pan is heated up you pour the eggs into the pan and allow them to cook for just a few minutes.  While the eggs are cooking it is best to mix the eggs around with a spatula so that they cook evenly.  Once the eggs are cooked you can shut the heat off on the stove and pour the eggs on to a plate.  The last step is to eat the eggs.\n",

In thinking about this, you should first decide whether you would like to grow your own or you would like to go to the grocery store and buy some oranges. Either way, you must make sure that you select only the freshest oranges. After picking multiple, you should prepare something to squeeze the juices out of the orange juice. This may be through machinery or you can do this by hand. Either way, it is important to get an appropriate cup and make only the right amount that you want. After orange having put the orange juice into the cup, you should prepare to drink the orange juice to drink and make sure to throw out any bit of the skin. After doing this, the juice should taste good. However, make sure to remove the pulp if you don't like it.\n",

There is a tennis court outside of our apartment clubhouse, so we decided to rent some tennis racquets and balls from our clubhouse. We first met up at the clubhouse to pick up the racquets and balls. We then went to the changing room inside the clubhouse to change into our tennis outfits. I changed into a tennis skirt and put on some tennis shoes. My friend changed into athletic clothes as well and put on a tennis visor. We then went to the tennis court with our gear. I asked my friend whether she wanted to serve the ball first, and she agreed. We volleyed the ball back and forth for a while, and I felt proud that my tennis skills hadn't gotten rusty. After we'd played for an hour, a couple joined us and asked if we wanted to play doubles. We ended up playing for another two hours!\n",

I turned the water on first to get it to the right temperature so it wouldn't be too hot or too cold when I stepped in.  Once I got the water to a satisfactory temperature, I stepped into the shower and shut the door.  I stood under the water for a few moments so that my hair could get wet since it is difficult to lather shampoo up with dry hair.  Once I was ready, I put some shampoo in my hand and then rubbed it through my hair.  As it lathers, I make sure to close my eyes so I won't get any soap in them.  Once it's lathered through, then I step back under the water and wash the soap out by rubbing my hair with my hands until I notice no more bubbles are coming out.  My hair gets dry, so I only do this once.  Then I put conditioner in my hand and rub that through my hair.  I get my head out of the water for a bit and finish up cleaning myself so the conditioner has a little time to work.  Once I'm done with everything else, I step back under the water and rinse out the conditioner.  My shower is done, so I turn the water off, open the shower door, get my towel and dry off.  Once I'm done drying off, I wrap the towel around my head so it can start getting some of the excess moisture from my hair.  Now it's time to get everything else ready for the day.\n",

If I do recognize the number I take a minute to determine a couple of things.  First I decide if I want to speak with the person who is calling, then I determine if I have enough time to speak to the person on the other end.  Once I decide to answer the phone I do so and I say hello.  I then wait for the other persons response and I try and gauge why they are calling me and if they need something from me.  I do not really enjoy talking on the phone so I usually try and end the conversation quickly.  Once the conversation is over I always say good bye to the person who is calling me and I hang up the phone.\n",

While I was at the grocery store , I looked for everything on the list . Some of them were hard to find , so I had to ask a worker where to find them . They were very helpful and pointed where to go . Some of the items were not available so I had to get a rain check . After I got all the available items , I had to stand on line at the checkout . The line was very long and there were no other checkout lines open . It was frustrating because I did not have that much items to buy . Meanwhile , there were at least four people ahead of me with a lot of items to buy . I am very impatient . Fortunately , one person ahead of me was kind enough to let me skip him . I was very appreciative . Finally , I left the grocery store with my items . \n",

I walked out of the kitchen and down the hallway towards the front door. I walked up to the door and looked through the peephole, so I could see who had rung the doorbell. I smiled when I saw that it was my grandmother. Then, I turned the top and bottom locks to unlock the door. I twisted the doorknob, and pulled the door open. I greeted my grandmother with a big \"Hello!\" and stepped aside so that she could walk through the doorway. Once my grandmother was inside the house, I closed the front door behind her and turned the locks in the opposite direction to lock the door again. I gave my grandmother a hug, asked her if she was hungry, and we walked together towards the kitchen. We sat down for breakfast and had a nice conversation.\n",

I let them do this throughout the day because there is not point in trying to clean until they're too tired to pull out any more toys. When they get to that point then I say, okay it's clean up time. We go from room to room gathering all the toys. Then I make them decide where each thing should go. They have to remember which bin, closet, bedroom, cabinet, etc each toy came from. Then we place them all back as neatly as we can. Barbies go with barbies, legos go with legos, crayons go with coloring books. Everything has a place. Once the toys are back in their appropriate places I give everyone a gold star. And maybe a cookie. And I give myself coffee. Because I've earned it.\n",

First, I gathered two large eggs, the canisters of salt and pepper, and a empty cup, placing them all on the countertop. Before I started to beat the eggs, I placed a skillet on the stove, and turned on the heat to medium. I placed a tablespoon of vegetable all into the skillet, and covered the base of the skillet evenly. I left the skillet on the stove to heat up, and then turned to get my eggs ready for cooking. I cracked both eggs into the cup, separating the egg yolk and white from the shells. After emptying the contents of the egg into the empty cup, I discarded the shell in the garbage. To the eggs in the cup, I added a dash of pepper, and an equal amount of salt. I used a fork to beat the eggs so that the yoke, whites, salt and pepper was evenly mixed inside the cup.   the skillet was smoking slightly, which let me know that it was high enough and ready for the eggs. So I quickly poured the ag mixture into the skillet, using the fork to scrape the inside of the cup to make sure all of the egg came out. After setting the cup to the side, I used a plastic spatula to stir the eggs in the skillet, to allow them to cook evenly and thoroughly. I constantly stir the eggs until it was all completely cooked, scraping the sides and the bottom of the skillet to ensure that none of the egg is overcooked or burning.\n",

We drive on the main roads, and she keeps a close watch to make sure I don't break any laws. She has a special brake pedal on her side of the car, so if I really get in trouble she can hit the brakes herself.

I remove the lens cap, unlock my phone and open the camera application. I usually have to turn the brightness of my screen up, especially when it is very sunny outside. I make sure to focus the shot by tapping the screen where I am trying to get the camera to focus on and tap the shutter button. I like to take several shots from different distances and angles to make sure I get the best shot possible. I then go through the pictures I just took and try to find the best one(s).

Tomato seedlings have to be started in a pot indoors before they can be taken outside. Once they get big enough I will take them out to my garden plot. I will dig a hole with my garden shovel and place the plants in the ground. I will water them. As they grow I will have to attach stakes to them to hold them up. Tomatoes grow long and spindly stalks. Once the tomatoes start growing the stalks won't hold them up unless they are secured with stakes or cages. The cages can be bought at the store as well. I will have to keep watering my plants as well as spraying bug killer on them. Bugs love tomatoes.\n",

My father and I later went out for a walk through the woods as a means of enjoying the nature we had been gifted - of course the dogs accompanied. The next day, I helped my grand mother prepare the family and its extended relatives an enormous feast, featuring turkey, gravy, cake assortments, corn, rice, and all types of baked breads.

I prop up all of the pillows and gently pat them to fluff them out. I pick up the blankets off of the floor that my wife kicks off in the middle of the night. While she goes to bed freezing, she always gets hot in the middle of the night and kicks off the blankets onto the floor. I fold those up and put them in the blanket chest. I pick up the comforter. I allow the comforter to billow out as I wave it out over the bed in an effort to get it to fall perfectly over the bed. When I finally get it just right, I fold the top of the comforter over slightly about four or five inches to give it that neat and tidy look.

I turned my back for what seemed like only five minutes and when I turned back, almost an entire wall was full of my son's drawings that he had done with our permanent markers! I was upset, but also a bit relieved because I had been meaning to paint that wall for quite some time and now I had an excuse to do so. I went down to our basement storage room to dig up the paint that matched the paint on that wall. Once I found the paint, I went back upstairs and put newspaper on the floor so I wouldn't get paint anywhere. I used blue painters tape to go around the edges of the wall and poured some paint into a container. I used a rolling paintbrush to go over the entire wall, and made sure to fully cover the area where my son had painted. I waited for the wall to dry, then removed the painters tape and cleaned up the newspaper. I had a beautiful, freshly painted, and clean wall!\n",

When I found out he had passed, I immediately booked plane tickets back to my home town. I went to the airport a few days later, and flew back to my hometown where I was greeted by my mother and sister. I went to the funeral the following day after getting dressed and ready. It seemed strange to get ready for such a thing. My best friend came with me to show her support. She stayed by my side the entire time. We greeted familiar faces, and new ones. Once the ceremony began, my sister and I both took our seats alongside my father. A song was played first about loving fathers, which was sad and had almost 80% of the guests in tears. After a brief ceremony, people were able to stand up at the podium and tell stories of my grandfather, that were mostly pretty funny. It was sad that my grandfather had passed, but I found myself happy that he was finally at peace and we could share these happy memories of him together.\n",

I knew I would need to wrap the box to make it look nice, so I chose blue wrapping paper, since blue is his favorite color. I cleared my kitchen table and unrolled the wrapping paper so I had a large, flat piece on the table. I sat the box on top and used my new scissors to cut the wrapping paper to a good length and width. I made sure it was long enough and wide enough to completely cover the box. I pulled up two side of the paper and taped it to the box. Then I wrapped up the ends so that no part of the box was showing, and taped those together. I turned the gift over and placed a bow and a birthday card on top. He was very happy with his gift.\n",

I pull in making sure i am facing the right way (remember the arrow on the fuel gauge points to the side the tank is on) I turn the car off and make sure to bring my keys and wallet into the store with me. I wait in line patiently and when it's my turn i say to the cashier; ten on three please and he repeats it back to me to make sure he heard right. I hand him a twenty dollar bill and he hands me back a ten dollar bill as change. I leave the store unlock my car and pop the gas cover.

I took my laundry down stairs. I added detergent without measuring it since there were so many clothes. I started the washing machine. I went back up stairs and begin cooking and cleaning. Shortly I went up to the third floor to make up the bed. I laid on the bed to relax for a few minutes. I accidentally fell asleep for an hour or two. I awake ran down stairs to check on the clothes when soap detergent  was all over the floor and my clothes weren't wash or clean. I begin doing the  laundry all over again.

It took me a long time to prepare the picnic, but it was worth it. I got up early that morning and started preparing the food. I decided to make sandwiches, potato salad, and chocolate cake. I made simple ham sandwiches with bread, ham, cheese and mustard. I cut each sandwich down the middle and placed them on a plate. I wrapped the plate in plastic wrap and put it in my basket. Then I prepared the potato salad, using my grandmother's recipe, and put it in a big bowl. I put that into the basket with the sandwiches. I then found a chocolate cake that I had bought at the grocery store, and put it in the basket. I brought napkins, paper plates, and forks with me to the park to meet my friends.

I took my favorite rubby ducky toy in with me so I could imagine being in a strong storm while under the water. It was fun. After drying off with my towel and getting dressed, I noticed something. There was sand, and a dirt scum ring going around the tub. I looked at myself and said you're nice and clean now. I couldn't believe that all that dirt had came from me playing all day. I ran to tell my father, \"Dad, look at the dirt I made\"? He laughed while coming up the stairs with a few cleaning bottles in his hand. \"Well you made this mess, now let's clean it\", he said. He looked into the hall closet and picked up two hand towels. I said, \"Dad what are you going to do?\". He looked at me and said \"grab a towel, I'll spray and you'll wipe\". He sprayed from a bottle that read \"Shower Cleaner\". He sprayed it about 3 times and the spray begin turning into foam bubbles. I wiped wherever he sprayed. The dirt scum ring started to disappear and it was back white and shiny. After we finished spraying we turned on the shower and rinsed the tub out with the water. The foam  bubbles even had a nice smell to it which made the whole bathroom smell good. My dad and I had cleaned the shower and it was just like new again.\n",

We could either go out and get some tea or we could make our own tea. We decided to make our own tea. The first step was to put the water in the large canister. Then, we put the tea bags in the kettle and then we mixed it together and boiled it. Then, finally after it was all boiled, we put it in the refrigerator and waited for a while before it was nice and cold. Then, we felt like we finally drink it.

It was exciting but also stressful at the same time. We had a family of five and had to figure out and agree one a vacation destination together as a group. In the end, it came down to choosing between Italy or London, England. We heard the Italy is not as nice to visit in the summer. That it can end up being really hot and a bit smelly. So we decided on London. We were very happy with that choice. There was so much to do there and we were never bored. We even managed to fit in a day trip to see Paris.

I placed the key that the salesman had given me into the ignition and turned it to the right until the engine roared to life.  I adjusted the seat so I was comfortable and could see the speedometer and the cars in front of me, and adjusted the mirrors so they were aimed at the road behind me.  I placed my right foot on the brake pedal, shifted the car into reverse, looked in each of my mirrors and glanced over both my shoulders to make sure no other cars were coming up behind me before I gradually lifted my foot from the brake pedal.  I carefully backed out of the parking spot, keeping my eyes on my mirrors.  I placed my right foot back on the brake and shifted into drive before moving my foot from the brake pedal to the gas pedal.  When I had moved the car forward to the parking lot exit, I placed my right foot on the brake carefully so as not to jerk to a stop at the intersection and turned on my left turn signal.

We drove to Home Depot and bought all of the supplies we would need. Once back home, we had the fun work of ripping up the old floor. That was fun, but very messy. Next we had to make sure it was very clean. If there was any dirt or debris, the floor wouldn't lay down flat. Once, the area was completely clean, we put the glue all over the bare cement. Then we carefully laid down the floor pieces, making sure that the pattern was aligned correctly. The final step was to wait for the entire thing to dry.

We used a steamer and some sharp tools to scrape off the old wallpaper.  It took a while but we had a clean wall after that.  At that point, we shopped around for a wallpaper that we would really like for that room.  After we bought our wallpaper, we brought it down to the basement room we were papering.

I thought about all the people I wanted to invite and wrote all their names in a long list.  Then I got on my computer and found a nice looking invitation form on the Internet.  I downloaded it, and could add the name of each person I wanted to invite.  I also had a link to a page on Facebook for the event, where people could say if they would be attending the party or not.  I printed these off, and stuffed them in envelopes.  Then I had to make sure I knew everyone's address so the invitations would get to the right place.  I addressed and stamped the envelopes, and carried them all to my mailbox.  A few days later, the invitations arrived and people began to RSVP if they could make it or not.\n",

The family thanked Jim and paid him the money that he asked for.

Once that was done, I washed my knife again and cut the outer edges of the onion off before cutting it long ways. Onions make your eyes water so it's okay if you start crying!

I took out a vegetable peeler and started to peel the carrots, and when I was satisfied, I pulled out a knife and cutting board and proceeded to slice the carrots on the cutting board.  I went back to the boiling chicken and stirred it around a bit, and then went to the potatoes I had put on the counter.  I washed off some of the dirt from the potatoes but didn't work that hard at it because I was going to peel them anyway.  I then proceeded to dig out the potato's \"eyes\" which are essentially little buds or sprouts that will form new potatoes.  I then peeled the potatoes and rinsed them off and finally I sliced them up.  At this time the chicken was about done, so I pulled out the chicken pieces and proceeded to peel the meat from the bones and then discarded the bones.  I put the carrots and potatoes in the chicken stock, and boiled them until they were tender.  I then put the chicken pieces back in and the rest of the spices and stirred it around.  Finally I poured a bowl of soup for myself, making sure I got pieces of chicken, carrots and potatoes.  It was still very hot and I had to sit and blow on it for a while until it became cool enough to eat.  By this time, my Dad had come home and he was hungry too, so instead of lunch we ate an early dinner of this delicious soup.  Finally finished with the soup which was very good, I put the empty dishes into the dishwasher to be cleaned later.\n",

I figured that I should bake it myself since I do not bake fairly often . I looked throughout my pantry and realized I had everything I needed . I went ahead and made it the evening before using all of the ingredients . I mixed the flour , sugar , water , eggs and even made my own frosting and did n't use one from a can .

Now that my hair and face were clean, I moved onto cleansing my body. I have two kinds of bar soap that I like to use - vanilla scented and lavender scented.

We always lived far away, a couple of states, away from the extended family. I'm not sure if that's an advantage or a disadvantage of being raised in the military. So going to visit relatives wasn't just packing up and going across town. We packed up, sometimes even got on airplane. When we went to visit relatives, we would stay for a couple of days or a week. So we'd spend a couple of days before hand just cleaning the house and packing our bags. Then there was the drive, usually lasted two days and a night spent in a motel (which was my favorite part of the whole thing.) Usually the first person we would visit would be my grandmother, my mother's mother. She was a bit uptight but man, could she cook. She always made two or three pies when we were there. After a couple of days, we'd always drive over and visit an aunt or a cousin, or sometimes both. Then there was the drive home. Again, staying in the motel overnight was always my favorite part.\n",

Because of this, whenever my dad is home in the morning and doesn't need to leave for work, he makes eggs for himself, my brother, and my mom.

I saw him crack a certain amount of eggs into a bowl, and I saw him scramble them with a fork. After this, he prepared a pan on the stove where he would cook the eggs. He set the heat on the stoves and put just the right amount of oil in the pan. Then, he would pour a bit of the scrambled eggs into the pan and cook them to perfection.

I gathered up different ingredients to make myself some food to bring. I made myself a big sandwich and packed some tasty chips. I also boiled some eggs and peeled them. All the food I wanted to bring I put inside plastic boxes and bags to keep them safe. I had all my food ready, but needed a place to eat and somewhere to sit on that wasn't grass. I decided to pack a big blanket to lay on the grass. That would be much more comfortable and would keep any bugs in the grass away from my food. I went outside with all my supplies and looked for a nice place to set my picnic up.\n",

Before deciding where they go, they deliberated and reviewed prices and debating, etc. They really had differing opinions about where to stay and how to camp. They decided that they would go to the Catskills. First, they had to find tents to stay in and reserve a shop on the campsite. Next, they looked at the campsite and checked out pricing and what would be included in their stay. Later, they were ready to go. They drove and arrived at the campsite and spoke with members of the facility about the  amenities. They had a lovely time and felt like they were relaxed and refreshed. They shared their experiences with both family and friends and were away from most of the action going on in the world.\n",

And there are some beaches in different parts of the word that I can take an airplane to. Today I am going to a beach near me but I have to drive to. I am going to take everything I need to have fun at the beach: sunglasses, towel, swim suit, sun screen and food and something to drink. When I get to the beach I have to find a place to the things I brought. I lay my towel on the beach sand far enough from the water so it will not get wet. Usually I get into the ocean water and swim all around. Or other times I play in the waves. This makes me hungry and I eat the food I brought, then take a nap on my towel.\n",

Since we live in the suburbs move than 40 miles from downtown, we drove to the station at the end of the line and parked our car.  At this part of the route, the train is above the ground.  We paid for our tickets and walked through the turn-style gate.  When the train arrived, we waited until the door opened and we walked in.  We found a seat for two and sat down before the train left the station.  It took us 40 minutes to ride downtown and half way there, the train went underground.  When they announced the next stop was the museum, we got up and stood by the door.

This made me both very excited and very nervous. I spent the next day trying to pick out the clothes that would make me look my best in front of the manager. The next day, just an hour before the interview, I noticed that my car had a flat tire. I realized that there was not nearly enough time for me to change the tire, so I called for a taxi on my phone. After changing into my outfit, I heard the taxi honk right outside my home. I locked up my house and got in the taxi.

I wanted the 'windows' without streaks so the imaginary tenants could see the beautiful imaginary view!  I cleaned the toilet as if I were cleaning a tank at Sea World - imaging I was making a better home for some beautiful fish and how grateful they would be.  I then cleaned the sink making the water swirl as if it were a dance.  I cleaned the faucets as if they were mirrors and made sure I could see myself.  Finally, I cleaned the floor, imagining my mop as my waltz partner making sure to cover all the corners humming every step of the way!

She had a temperature of one hundred and four degrees.  I told her I would be right back.  I went down to the kitchen and got the medicine we use to reduce fevers.

I turned off the car, and remembered to take my credit card out of my wallet before getting out of the vehicle.  I swiped my credit card at the gas pump's computer to authorize the purchase.

I turned the car on, turned the radio up and turned on the air conditioner. I looked around and did not see anyone coming so I put the car in reverse and backed out of my space. I put the car in drive and pulled out of the parking lot. I pressed my foot lightly on the gas because I knew there was a stop sign, I stopped at the stop sign and looked to make sure no one was coming. I turned right onto the road and stopped at the top of the hill at the red light by putting my foot on the brake. When the light turned green, I gave it some gas and continued on my way to work.

Since the tank was only half full I went to the shelf and got my gas can. I topped up the tank with the gas can, then put it back on the shelf. Next, I pushed the mower out into the lawn and grabbed the starter cord with both hands. I yanked as hard as I could until the engine started up with a roar. Then, I pushed the mower in straight lines across the lawn until I had covered the entire yard. I turned off the mower and put it away in the garage, then I grabbed my rake off a shelf near where I keep the mower.

Our garden has a lot of flowers in it, but we thought it would be fun to plant some vegetables as well. We went to the store and picked up some supplies that we would need, like a small shovel, a small watering can, and some vegetable seeds (including carrot seeds, tomato seeds, and cucumber seeds). We then went to our backyard and started to dig small holes in the soil so that we would have space to plant our seeds. We dropped the seeds into the small holes and then patted the soil back on top. Then we filled the watering can and watered each small mound of soil that had seeds underneath. All in all, working in the garden was a great way to spend the afternoon.\n",

I opened the door only a crack so that I could talk with her. \"Good morning, my name is Nadia. I just moved into the house next door. I wanted to introduce myself to my new neighbors,\" she said. I opened the door a little wider and stepped outside on my front porch. I shook her hand. \"It's good to meet you, Nadia,\" I said. \"Welcome to the neighborhood.\" She smiled and handed me a business card with her phone number on it. \"I look forward to seeing you around,\" she said as she walked down the steps and on to the next house.\n",

I washed all of my vegetables in my sink and dried them with a paper towel. I decided to start with my carrots first. I took my vegetable peeler and peeled off a thin layer of the carrot. I took out my wooden cutting board and a sharp knife. Then I chopped off the top and bottom of the carrot and threw those pieces away. I cut the carrot in half lengthwise and then chopped it into smaller, bite size pieces. I put the pieces in my soup pan. Then it was time to cut the celery. I cut off the top and the bottom of the celery and threw those pieces away. Just as I did with the carrot, I first cut the celery in half length wise, then chopped it into smaller bite size pieces. I added the celery to the carrots in the soup pan. I then peeled off all the dried brown skin on my onion and chopped off the top knot and the bottom knot and threw those away.

So i giver her water and then I take 2 spoons and crush her medicine. I put in on a spoon and she takes it and swallows the crushed medicine with her cup of water. Then at night she has to take a different medication, it is a shot. I put together her shot and get the dosage correct. She then tells me where she wants her shot and rubs an alcohol pad on the spot. I then insert the needle and count to ten to make sure all of the medication did go in. And if she takes her both of her medicine without crying she will get a treat such as a cookie or a piece of candy for being so brave.\n",

I am planning this well in advance so I will know how many people will be attending. First I will make a list of the people I want to invite. Then I will go to the card store and buy some invitations. I will also have to get enough stamps from the post office in order to mail the invitations. I would like people to RSVP (that is, let me know they are coming) so I will also include a small card with an envelope and a stamp so they can do this by mail. Or they can call me, so I will include my phone number on the invitation. This is not a surprise party, so their responding will not ruin anything. Now I will address and put stamps on all of the envelopes. Then I will put the invitations and the RSVP materials in the envelopes, and finally seal the envelopes. I will take the envelopes to the post office and put them in the mailbox. At this point I will be awaiting the invited guests' answers and I will start planning the party meal and activities.\n",

Next I cleaned the sing and counter with a general bathroom cleaner.  I made sure the faucets were shining.  I cleaned the mirrors with glass cleaner and a separate cloth as not to mix the glass cleaner with the other cleaners I was using.  Next i scrubbed the toilet, using toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl and general bathroom cleaner for the outside areas.  I made sure to clean the bottom of the toilet and the floor around the toilet.  Next I cleaned the shower and tub with tile cleaner which removes soap scum or dried soap residue.  Finally I swept and mopped the floors.  After finishing cleaning in bathroom I removed the rugs from the washing machine and hung them out to dry.

I do not live within walking distance, so my transportation choices were to take the train or to take a taxi cab. I decided to take a taxi. I stood outside of the club and held out my hand so I could flag down one of the taxis driving by. A few taxis drove by before one stopped for me. I opened the door and asked the driver if he was available to drive me to my neighborhood. He replied yes. I got into the backseat of the taxi. The driver asked if I had a preference on which route to take. I said yes and proceeded to give the driver directions on how to get to my apartment building. The drive took about 15 minutes.

During the weekend I started putting away my furniture. Every afternoon when I go outside getting my furniture move in I continue hearing a noise as a little kitten was some where near. I continues to look but there was no sight of a cat. Two days later as I return from work I heard the noise of a cat, but still I didn't see anything in sight. I went up stairs and took a shower, shortly I came back down stairs, open the door and there was a cat standing at my front door. I brought the cat inside, because it seems cold. I wrapped it up in a blanket and begin feeding the cat cat food and milk. After an hour the cat seem to be okay and I kept him as my pet.\n",

I took them to a botanical garden and decided to take a couple of photographs of them. I asked them to stand in front of a sculpture of a bird surrounded by beautiful flowers. I took out my phone and pressed the button to turn it from phone mode to photography mode. I told my two grand daughters to stand on either side of the sculpture. I made sure the sun was behind me. I told them to look at the sculpture and smile. I looked at the screen on my phone and I could see what the picture would look like. I backed up a couple of steps so I could get more flowers in the picture. I held the phone still until everything on the screen looked in good focus. I clicked a button to take the picture. The screen froze, went blank, and then the picture I took popped up. It looked perfect.\n",

      " 1009).I was hungry so I went into the kitchen and looked into the refrigerator for something to eat. There was a package of hotdogs, so I decided to cook two. I went into the bottom kitchen cabinet and took out a small pot. I filled it about halfway with water. Next, with permission, I took a non-sharp butter knife and carefully opened the package of hotdogs. My mom watched me use the butter knife to make sure I did not hurt myself. I rinsed the hot dogs off and then placed them in the pot of water.  The hotdogs I was not going to cook, were placed back into the refrigerator to keep them fresh. Walking over to the stove, I checked to make sure it was not hot before I placed the pot on an eye. Next I reached over and turned the eye on high until the water began to boil, rapidly. Once this happened, I carefully reached over the stove and turned the eye down to medium high. After five minutes, I check the hot dogs to see if they are done. I judge this by them turning darker or getting plumper. Sometimes if I am not sure, I let them cook until they start to split. When I am satisfied that they are ready, I turn the eye off and use a potholder to carefully place the pot on another eye that is not hot. I let the pot sit on the stove for a minute or two. Carefully I remove the pot from the stove and carry it over to the sink. I want to make sure I do not scald myself with the hot water from the pot so I run cold water in the pot for 30 seconds to one minute before I drain the water off by pouring it down the sink. Careful my mom tells me, as I almost let my hot dog slip out of the pot with the draining water. Once all the water is gone, I put the pot of the baseboard. Next I get a plate and place two hotdog buns on it. I have to remember to retie the package of hotdog buns and put them back into the bread box. I open the hotdog buns up far enough to add condiments but not far enough to split them apart so that they break. My favorite condiments are Ketchup, Mustard and Mayonnaise. My mom adds onions, relish and Sauerkraut to her hotdogs but I don't care for any of that on mine. I prefer to add cheese. Once I have 'dressed' my hotdog buns, I go over to the pot, take a form and remove my hotdogs before placing one on each bun. I place the pot in the sink so I can wash it after I finish eating. Finally I can sit down at the table and enjoy my hotdogs.\n",

I was so excited I almost started and forgot to do the basic preparations that must take place beforehand. I had to move all the furniture such as my bed and my night stand. I then cleaned the walls to make sure the paper stuck. Once I did that I went and bought some wall paper. I chose wall paper that was blue because it is my favorite color and I chose space men as the design because outer space is so cool. Now with all the prep work done it was time to actually jump to the actual task of putting the wall paper on the walls. I cut the wall paper into pieces that would fit perfectly on the wall and then put glue on the back. Then I rolled it gently on the wall. I followed this process until it was all done. Voila!

I look on the Internet for a good recipe for soup and gather the ingredients I will need. This soup needs carrots, potatoes, and beef it looks like. I read the recipe to find out how to make the broth for the soup, and prepare the broth. I then cut up the carrots and potatoes into small chunks, and throw them into the broth. The broth is hot on the stove in a pot, so I am careful not to touch it when I put the carrots and potatoes in. The recipe says the beef has to be cooked separately, so I set a frying pan on a burner on the stove. I cut the beef into small pieces and cook them in the pan on a medium heat setting. Once the beef is cooked, I throw it into the broth and let everything sit for an hour or two. The soup is now ready.\n",

I selected a title that I had not heard of before but had 4 stars. One of the great things about Netflix was that if we didn't like it, we could return to the menu and pick something new. I turned off the lights in the living room and then sat back down on the couch. We watched as the intro scene played on the television and then progressed into the story.

It is not too busy inside and we are able to walk right up to the counter and the employee takes our order. We get a cheeseburger happy meal, and a chicken salad. The employee asks what type of toy Alex wants in his happy meal, and we decide on a Super Mario figurine. As we wait for our food, I pour a soda from the vending machine, and find a high chair for Alex to sit in. Our order number is then called, so we go back to the counter and get our tray. We sit down at our table, and I chop up Alex's cheeseburger. He steals some of my cherry tomatoes. After we finish lunch, he spends a little while going down the slide in the play area and having fun with some other children. Finally, we get ready to head home, because it's time for Alex to take his nap.\n",

I looked up the recipe first to make sure I put the temperature on the stove was correct and that I put the right amount of milk in the pot that I needed. Once I knew what to do, I put the stove on medium high and took a pot out of the cabinet and placed it on the burner that was on. I then took out the measuring cup and poured the milk into it up to the 1 cup mark. I poured the milk into the pot which was on the stove on the burner. I needed to watch it really carefully to not over boil it. After a few minutes the milk started having little bubbles along the edges.

I was in a hurry, so I pulled up to the drive through line and waited my turn. There were 3 cars ahead of me, so it took a few minutes. When my turn came I drove up to the intercom and looked over the huge menu above it. A nice voice greeted me and asked me what I wanted to order. I picked out a hamburger with fries. The lady who was talking into the intercom told me how much it would cost, and I pulled up to the window to pay. When I got up to the window a smiling lady took my money and handed me a white bag with a nice, juicy hamburger inside and a receipt stapled to the outside.

Next, I pulled the top sheet taught and tucked it in around the edges of the bed.  Then, I pulled the wool blanket up and smoothed it out.  I was careful to make sure the edges of the wool blanket were also tucked under the mattress.  After that, I pulled the comforter over the queen sized bed and made sure there were not wrinkles in the bedding.

Last summer I had a barbecue in my backyard and invited some friends over to grill some hot dogs. There are many ways to cook hot dogs: boiling, baking, in a pan on the stovetop, but nothing gives a great smoky flavor like a nice, hot grill. I preheated the grill and put the hot dogs on the burner, making sure to turn them often. On a separate table I set up different toppings guests could have like: ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, and mayonnaise. When cooking hot dogs, I can never forget the buns. My favorite way is to butter the inside of the rolls and grill them for about a minute, so the inside gets buttery and crispy. All my friends enjoyed the hot dogs and had a great summer day.\n",

I lived in southern California, and they lived in central Arizona, and the drives to go from where I lived to where they lived took hours. These trips were usually just for the weekend, and we would usually prepare for them a day before. We would pack all of our clothes that we would use, along with our toiletries, and put them in our suitcases. On the day we were leaving, we would usually load up the car and leave fairly early in the morning. We would try to make as little stops as possible over the whole trip, really only stopping for gas and food. After about 4 to 5 hours, we would arrive at my aunt's house in Arizona, and we would spend the entire weekend over there just hanging out with them. Leaving was always sad, because we knew we wouldn't get to see them for months.\n",

I decided to make the linguine. I got a large pot from the cupboard, filled it with water, and a pinch of salt. While I waited for the pot of water to boil, I grated some parmesan cheese. Once the water came to a boil, I emptied the box of linguine into the pot. I stirred the linguine so that it would not stick together. After ten minutes, I drained the linguine in a colander in the sink. Then I placed the linguine into a pan on the stove over medium heat. To create a simple sauce, I drizzled some olive oil over the pasta, and added a tablespoon of butter to the pan. I then added freshly ground pepper and the parmesan cheese I grated earlier.

I  asked them when they could see me, and they gave me some times I could choose. I picked one and told them I would be there at that time and on that day. I got in my car and drove to the doctor's office.I had to first check in at the front desk with the receptionist. She told me it would be a bit of a wait, and told me I could sit and fill out paper work for the appointment. The papers asked me about my health and life. I filled them all out and returned them to the receptionist. I waited some more. Finally, they called my name. I first met with a nurse. She weighed me, checked my height and used machines to check my temperature and blood pressure. She left and the doctor came in. I told him what was wrong and he told me he would write me a prescription for some medicine to help me get well again. I left the room and talked to the receptionist again, to pay my fee and left.\n",

Then I went into the bathroom and cleaned the shower, toilet and sink using more cleaning solution. I then went back to the main room and got the vacuum and broom out. I went into the bathroom and swept the tile floor. Then I got the mop out and mopped the bathroom floor. I then returned to the kitchen and cleaned the stovetop.

I pulled out the top dishwasher rack first, and unloaded my glasses, mugs, and salad bowls. Next, I pulled out the bottom dishwasher rack and unloaded my plates and a large soup pot. I saved unloading the silverware for last, as its my least favorite part of unloading the dishwasher.

I also checked to make sure that the water drain was clear of any food particles. Then I let closed the dishwasher door so that it locked and wouldn't swing open on its own.

When we were in the hospital, she only went to the bathroom a few times, but I changed her diaper there.  I got her diaper and wipes ready before I changed it.  Then, when she would cry, I would take her onesie off and take off her old diaper.  I would make sure that she was really clean down there and then get ready to put the new diaper on.  When she was ready, I would put the new diaper on below her, and then put the new straps on.  Then, after I was done with that, I would put her onesie back on so that she would stay warm.

I asked my little boy if he wanted to come, and of course, he did. We gathered a bucket and an extended arm grabber tool. We headed outside and picked some oranges off the tree. We found that twisting them off the branch was easiest. We also used the grabber to pick up the fruit that had fallen off the tree onto to ground. We filled out bucket and headed inside. Next, we got out our juicer. We rolled the oranges on the counter a little, to activate the juices. Then, we cut the oranges in half and pressed the on top the juicer, catching the juice in a container. We poured our juice over ice and had the most delicious glass of fresh orange juice ever!\n",

We ate the food on paper plates and talked to each other.  After we were done eating, everyone decided that we should play volleyball with water balloons.

I am afraid that I will get sick if I just pick it off since the grease would have gotten on other ingredients in the sandwich.

We fill a giant pot with chicken stock and add the chicken and vegetables. We add salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning to the pot as well. We place it on the stove and turn in on. We bring the pot of ingredients to a boil and then turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for several hours. The smell is amazing! About halfway through the cooking time, we open the lid of the pot and add in the pasta. The low cooking temperature will take time to cook the noodles but when the soup is ready, the noodles will be nice and soft. After several hours, the soup is ready!

I set the table with a plate for each of us, and candles for our dinner to be romantic. He made a rib eye steak with grilled asparagus and a Caesar salad. He even made a pound cake for dessert! After we ate, I was so full I didn't think that I could move but we needed to get the dishes going before we started watching our movie. I first took all of the glasses off of the table and set them on the top rack of the dishwasher. Then, I grabbed both of our plates and put the silverware on top of them. I rinsed everything off and put it in the dishwasher. Once the washer was going, I went back to the table with a wet rag and wiped everything down so the table was nice and clean again.

I filled the dishwasher with soap and turned it on. There were still a few big dirty dishes left in the sink, though. Those I would have to wash by hand because they were too big to fit into the dishwasher. I grabbed a sponge and sprayed some soap onto it.

Today, I was eating a plate of chicken, and found that some of the chicken wasn't cooked enough. I told the waiter this, and she said she would take the plate back and get me a fresh plate of food. She took the plate from me and went back into the kitchen, where she would explain to the chef there that the food have been underdone. The chef will then prepare me a fresh plate of food, and when he's done, the waiter will bring it out for me to enjoy. This can take some time, because the chef has to start fresh and make sure he doesn't make any new mistakes. Soon the chef is done, and the waiter comes out with a fresh plate of food for me to eat.

I pulled the old and full bag up by its sides, being very careful not to spill anything or break open a hole in the bag. I pulled it out all the way and carefully sat it on the ground. When it was on the ground I tide up the side, by grabbing each side and pulling them into a knot. I set it aside, to bring to the dumpster later. I went to the cabinet and pulled out a new garbage bag. I rubbed the opening together to loosen it up so I could open it.

I started the letter with \"Dear Katie\", because her name is Katie. Then I started a new paragraph and wrote about some things that were happening in my life. I told her about what I'd been doing, and how I'd been feeling. When I'd written down everything I wanted to tell her, I wrote at the bottom, \"Love, Caitlin\" because my name is Caitlin. I folded up the paper and put it in an envelope. I licked the sticky part on the envelope and them pressed it down to seal the envelope. I wrote my address in the top left corner of the envelope, then my friends address in the center. In the top right corner I placed a stamp.

I will also need to buy some tape to seal the folds and edges of my wrapped gift. I did not have any paper that was appropriate for a birthday party. I only had wrapping paper left over from Christmas. This paper had reindeer and Santas on it. I go to the store to look for paper. I decided to pick a pink paper that has the words, \"Happy Birthday\" printed on it. It is very pretty and my friend's favorite color is pink. The paper is wrapped around a cardboard tube. When I unroll the paper at home, I lay my gift on the paper and cut a square out that is big enough to wrap around the present. I fold both sides of the paper in and tape them together. I do the same with the ends of the paper. Soon my present is completely covered and hidden under the pretty, pink paper and looks very beautiful. Finally, I tape a large, ruffled pink bow to the middle of the package. When I give the present to my friend she is delighted with the wrapping paper. She decides to unwrap her gift slowly, instead of tearing the paper off. She saves the paper to use again on someone else's present. My friend is completely surprised when she finds hiding underneath the paper is a jewelry box! Both my friend and I are happy.\n",

I sweep the crumbs into a dustpan and empty the dustpan into the garbage can. Next, I use a bucket and mop to give the floor a more thorough cleaning. I fill the bucket with warm water and mix about a quarter of a cup of floor cleaning liquid with it. I dip the mop into the cleaning solution in the bucket and remove it, draining any extra water back into the bucket, Then I move the wet mop around on the floor to clean it.

I went to the paint aisle to try make a decision of what color I liked best. They had a wide range of examples so I could make my choice easily. I picked the color I wanted then I went over to get a paint brush, floor cover, and painters tape. I checked out at the fastest register and headed home. When I got home I cleared out the space so I wouldn't get paint on everything. After the room was clear, I taped off the bottom and top edge of the wall and put the floor cover down.

Next, I mixed together some bread crumbs, corn meal, and Parmesan cheese.  I put some oil in a pan and heated it on the stove.  I dipped the pieces of fish into the egg mixture first, and then into the crumb and cheese mixture.  Next, I put the pieces of fish into the hot oil in the pan.  It made a nice sizzling sound.

I built some raised beds and purchased enough soil to fill them. I planted things that I would enjoy eating including tomatoes, green beans, basil, mint, parsley, zucchini, cucumbers, lettuce and some wildflowers to make it pretty and to encourage bees. Once I got everything planted I stopped by everyday to water and pick weeds. I did have to put some chicken wire around some of the plants because I noticed some of the plants looked like something was chewing on them, as the plants started getting bigger I also had to make some supports for the tomatoes and beans so they didn't fall over.

I didn't mind clearing the table, and I have always found sweeping to be deeply satisfying. But I detest doing the dishes. When I was about fifteen, I bet my father that if I got straight A's in school he would do the dishes for a year, and if I lost I would do the dishes for a year. I honestly have no idea what I was thinking because I had never gotten straight A's in my life. But like an idiot I thought with enough motivation it would be no problem, and not doing dishes was a huge motivator! It really sucked. After a while I felt like I was a dishwashing pro, but I just figured out a way to unload the silverware in much more efficient manner and I am kicking myself for not doing it this way for the last 30 years!

The first thing that I did was determine which pieces of clothing belonged to which member of the family, and I put them into separate piles, working on mine first. After this, I started folding separate groups of clothing one after another. I started with underwear, folding boxers, t-shirts, and bunching socks together, and putting them in my dresser drawer. Next, I folded my dress t-shirts. I do this by folding the shirts in half, first by the sleeves, then twice going down. Then, I folded my pants by the legs. Once all the clothes was folded, I put it all in it's own dresser drawer.\n",

I pulled out a small plastic jar labeled \"beta fish food flakes\" and unscrewed the lid. I then removed the cover from a small opening in the top of his fish tank making sure to not shake too much in, I carefully sprinkled a small amount of flakes into the tank through the small opening. Tom immediately swam to the flakes that were slowly sinking down into the water and began to nibble at them. Satisfied, I replaced the cover on the top of the tank and watched him eat for a few minutes. I then screwed the fish food lid back on and put it back inside of the drawer underneath his tank.\n",

We found our old picnic basket that was made of wicker and wiped it nice and clean. My daughter decided she wanted to make turkey wraps for us to eat so we got out the tortillas, turkey, cheese and lettuce. We also love grapes and watermelon so while she made wraps, I washed the grapes and sliced the watermelon and put it into containers to take. We filled our reusable water bottles with apple juice to drink and decided some yogurt would be nice to have so we put that in our basket too. We got our napkins, silverware and a nice big blanket to sit on. We put it all in the basket and decided that we had everything we wanted to eat.

I looked out the window to see if I recognized the car and I didn't. I looked out the peephole and saw someone standing there with a company logo on their shirt. I was not expecting anything from this company so I did not answer the door right away figuring that they were a door to door solicitor. The person continued to ring the doorbell and then began to knock. I went over to the door again and locked the chain lock. I cracked the door open and asked how I could help them.

I called for the dog to come to me, and he did. I kneeled down and I put the leash on the dog. I lifted each of the dogs front legs so that they could fit into the openings of the leash that would be secured around the dog. After his legs were in both of the openings, I fastened the leash by clipping the attachments over his back. I checked to make sure that the lease was not in the locked position, so that the dog could move freely without the and yanked back suddenly. Once I saw that the lease was in a freely moving position, I turned and opened the door. Once the door was open, the dog understood that it was time to go for a walk, so he shook himself off, then turned to exit the house, walking out the front door. I stepped outside the door and instructed the dog to stop and wait, while I locked the door to secure my home.

I place all of the clothing on top of the dryer in a pile so that I have easy access to it. I usually start with pants.  When I fold pants, I take both legs and fold them together, and then I bring both pant legs up to the waist and I have completed folding my pants. The next items that I fold are shirts. With shirts, I always fluff them out by giving them a good wave in the air.  Once I do that, I then place the shirt face down on top of the dryer.  I begin by folding in the sleeves and then I fold the bottom about half way up. I then fold in each side. Finally, I take the bottom of the shirts and fold it up to the top. Once all of my clothing has been folded, I place them in my laundry basket and bring them to my room to be put away. Folding my clothing keeps my clothes in good condition and makes them very easy to put away in my dresser drawers.\n",

I was lucky that I found the button after it fell off and did not need a replacement button. All I needed was a needle and thread. I found my sewing kit in the closet and opened it up to find that I had many options of what color thread to use. I decided to go with black thread to match the color of the original thread used in the other buttons on the shirt. I also had a choice of different size needles to use.

That way I don't have to pick them up as I get to them. I then get the vacuum out of the closet. Before I plug it in, I remove the dirt tray and empty it in the trashcan. I make sure the filter is on tightly, then I put the dirt tray back in. I plug in the vacuum, and turn it on. I start at the edge of the carpet and move the vacuum back and forth, overlapping small areas at a time. I move any furniture that I cannot vacuum under.

After taking off my mud-encrusted boots , I tiptoed towards the bathroom , where I knew a relaxing bath was in my future . I drew the water as hot as I could , and quickly filled the tub halfway with water . I stripped my clothes , first taking off me pants , then my shirt , socks , and underwear . Two drops of lavender oil and two cups of epsom salt is what I put into the tub , balancing out the temperature with cold water until it was just perfect .

Since wheat bread is better for me, I went with that choice. I pulled two piece of bread out and made sure to seal the bag well so the rest wouldn't become stale. I walked into the kitchen and put the two pieces of bread inside of the toaster. I set it to five, so it would come out perfectly crispy. I pressed down on the lever and it started to cook. While I waited, I watched the outside of the bread become nice and golden brown. It was very fun watching it cook. Once it was done, the toast popped up. I grabbed a plate out of the cupboard and put the two pieces of toast on it. I then ate the toast, which was delicious.\n",

I'd driven passed so many gorgeous gardens on my drive home from work each day, and I thought that I would enjoy my yard much more if it were filled with blossoming flowers. I had spent a day out shopping for all of the tools and seeds and other products I would need to make a garden grow strong and beautiful. Today I changed into clothing that I didn't mind messing up with dirt and grass stains. I gathered all of my gardening supplies into a wheelbarrow, and set out to work my garden. First I started turning up my soil with a shovel; mixing the dirt up and adding some manure into it so that it would be a good place to grow plants. I opened packs of seeds and poured them into small holes that I made in the freshly tilled earth, and I planted the holes in straight lines across my new garden bed. I sprinkled some dirt over the holes, then watered the ground. My day of gardening was done, and soon I would have fresh blooms blossoming in my new garden.\n",

We also had potato salad, a watermelon, some chips and french onion dip. Other people had brought food, as well. There ended up being about 25-30 people that showed up! We had set up a slip and slide and an inflatable pool for all the kids. There were also about 200 water balloons for everyone to throw at each other with. A lot of the adults enjoyed those! We had a game of horse shoes and a bean bag toss, as well. Between the food, the company, the holiday to commemorate the fallen and the sacrifice that they made to keep our freedoms (as well as, coming together to be good people, no matter who is in office) and the games, everyone had a lot of fun at the barbecue!!\n",

I thought this was very confusing , until a station employee stopped and explained the process to me . Soon I had my ticket , and was walking to line where I would await the train 's arrival . If was not far , and there was even an empty bench seat . Soon the train arrived and I stepped up into the car printed on my ticket , and found my seat .

After getting the number, I called it to ask if they would be able to send a taxi driver over in the next thirty minutes. I told the dispatcher my address, as well as the address of my destination (the location of the company that I was interviewing at). The dispatcher agreed to send the taxi at the agreed time and location. Thirty minutes later, I received a phone call from an unknown number. The taxi driver had arrived and was letting me know that he was waiting for me outside. I grabbed my briefcase and purse and ran outside to meet him. I then got into the taxi. The driver's meter kept track of how long we traveled for. Ten minutes later, we arrived at the location of the job interview.

After we decided on the place to build the bonfire, we collected large prices of branches, twigs and leaves. At the same time, two friends started digging a shallow pit of about one-and-a-half feet wide. Others went around the camp site to collect large pieces of rocks and placed them around the pit. That kept the fire from spreading outside of the pit. We arranged the branches and twigs like a pyramid and placed the leaves under it. I lighted a fire with lighter and the leaves started to burn. Then the twigs and branches started to catch the fire. We pulled up our picnic chairs around the bonfire and enjoyed sipping hot chocolate and eating snacks.\n",

Bills are payments of money that have to be made to pay for specific services, like water, electricity, and Wi-Fi. One monthly bill that my parents are constantly having to pay is the water bill. The first sign that the bill is due soon is getting a notice in the mail that says so. This notice has on it the amount of money that needs to be paid along with the date that it needs to be paid by. If the bill is not paid by this date, then the company that provides us with water will send us a disconnection notice in the mail. This lets them know that if my parents don't pay the bill soon, the company can shut off the water to our house, which won't allow us to do things like take showers, wash dishes, or do laundry. So, to avoid all of this, one of my parents will take whatever amount of money that is owed out of their bank account along with the bill they got in the mail, and take that to the nearest water company office to pay it off.\n",

To begin, we choose a safe location to build the fire where we will not catch anything else on fire. Next we gather dry wood and pile it up in our designated safe location. As a safety precaution, we also bring a water hose and a few buckets of water so that if the fire was to begin to spread, we could quickly stop it from getting out of control. After we have our wood and water, we also look for some leaves or something else that will easily catch fire such as newspaper. We then use this to light the fire with a very long lighter because we want to continue being safe. Once the fire has started, we gather around it and sit and visit. Once the flames have almost subsided, we roast marshmallows or hot dogs.\n",

When it was full, I brought it to the center of the yard.  I threw all the sticks and wood into a pile on the ground.  I pushed all the wood together making sure it was compact.  When everyone got there, it was time to light it.  I took a bit of newspaper and scrap and stuck it under some of the branches.  Then I went into the house to get the lighter.

We took our time visiting each exhibit and even had a chance to talk to a curator about specifics.  The curator was there to answer questions that visitors may have about the different dinosaurs on display.  She was very nice and helpful and told us a lot of neat things we wouldn't have otherwise known.\n",

One morning, though, the alarm clock didn't go off, and I ended up waking up and going to school much later than usual. After school that day, I realized that the battery on the alarm clock was probably dead, so I walked to a convenience store close to my school to pick up some batteries. I had my mom pick me up from the store, and after getting home, I changed the batteries on the alarm clock. The alarm clock turned on immediately after this, so I knew that it would work the next morning. That night, I set my usual alarm, and sure enough, it went off right on time the next morning. Unlike the day before, I was able to get all of my things ready and be at school right on time.\n",

The fast food restaurant had no waiters or menu card. There were several counters to order the food. There was a queue in front of every counter. We joined in one queue. When our turn came, we were asked to order our food by choosing from the variety of food items listed in a screen in front of us. I ordered a burger and a pocket of french fries and my friend ordered a chicken sandwich. After our order, we had to wait for few minutes for the food to get prepared. Once our food arrived, we collected them and went to a table in the restaurant and enjoyed our food. Once we finish the food, we ourselves had to return the empty plates at a particular place. It was a good experience.\n",

I usually start with the silverware first. I take the basket of silverware out of the dishwasher and carry it to the silverware drawer. That way I don't have to bend over so much. I put the silverware away in the proper holders in the drawer. Then I put the silverware basket back in the dishwasher, and check out the plates and bowls on the bottom rack of the dishwasher. I always make sure they are clean before I put them away, because sometimes food gets stuck and they aren't quite clean. I stack the plates and bowls in the cabinets. Then I unload the top rack of the dishwasher, which contains the glasses and mugs. I put them in the cabinet, nesting the mugs so I can fit them on the shelf.

We would break off into teams of two and face off against each other, and this usually made for great fun. First, we would make the teams. Sometimes, the P.E. teacher would let us pick our own teams, so we could pair up with a friend, or they would assign us with partners. No matter what the case was, the teams of two were able to always pick their opponents. Once everybody know who they were playing with, they took a spot on the court, and one person from each team would serve the ball. Serving the ball means throwing it up into the air and hitting into the opposing team's side of the court. The two people on each team would then keep the ball moving by hitting it back and forth onto the opposite side. Whenever someone wasn't able to hit the ball back, it was out, and that team lost a round.\n",

On one of these days, recently, I decided that I would be the one to cook dinner for them, figuring that they deserve a break after a whole day's worth of hard work. First, I had to figure out a meal that I could prepare that everyone would like. I ended up choosing to make some teriyaki chicken and rice. After deciding, I prepared the teriyaki sauce in a pan on the stove using soy sauce and brown sugar. Once the sauce was done, I added some chopped up chicken and mixed it well to make sure the chicken got an even coating of sauce. Separately from this, I cooked about 3 cups of rice in the rice cooker. I made just enough for everyone in my house, including me. Once they all got home from school and work, they were pleased to find that I had made dinner, and they all seemed to think it was delicious.\n",

As we walk in we get a shopping cart and start down the 1st aisle . Fruits and vegetables all stacked neatly in shelves . Potatoes in bags stacked next to the onions . Grapes in big bunches . This is my favorite aisle . I love the colors and the shapes . Here you can find some stuff I have never seen before . Star fruit , miniature bananas and blood oranges . We spend most of our time here . We are vegetarians so we do not go to the meat counter or the dairy aisle . We do go to the cereal aisle and I beg my mother every week for a different cereal treat . Sometimes she says yes and others no . But this week is yes and Frosted Flakes get tossed in the cart with delight . I am so excited about this that I do not pay much attention to the rest of the trip . I help my mom bag the groceries and put the bags in the trunk of the car .

You will also need a small frying pan, a bowl, a fork, a spatula, some butter, margarine, or oil, and a little bit of milk. First, crack the eggs by hitting them against the side of the bowl and let the egg fall into the bowl. Add a little bit of butter or oil to the frying pan and turn the stove on to medium heat until the butter melts. Add a little bit of milk to the eggs if you want to, but it is not necessary. Then, with a fork, mix or beat the egg mixture until the egg whites and egg yolks - the yellow part - are completely mixed together. When the pan is hot, pour the egg mixture in the pan and stir it with the spatula until the liquid begins to get hard or firm. Reduce or turn off the heat and continue to stir the eggs until they are as firm as you want them to be.\n",

I do n't know a lot about making cakes , but I have a super-huge baking pan , an oven , and a big sweet tooth ! I left the house looking around various convenience stores for cake mix ; it was Christmas , so going to a big store and wasting a bunch of time was out of the question . I had to spend a whole hour checking for a store that had any cake mix left ! I finally settled on two boxes of butter cake mix and some pink lemonade frosting and took it all home . Since my pan was way too big for just one box , I had to follow the instructions and double every ingredient while making the batter and pouring it in . I preheated the oven , put the cake pan with the batter in to bake , and watched TV for a few hours while I waited for it to be done . I checked the cake several times with a toothpick to make sure it was fully baked . Once it was done , I took it out to cool and frosted it , and then cut the cake into several square pieces . It went better than I expected for my first cake on short notice , but the frosting was SUPER sweet ! \n",

Also they know, at the beginning of each training session there should be a 10 minute obligatory warming up program containing exercise which prepare the tennis player , both physically and psychologically , for the strains of the training to follow. The warming up exercise program will normally start with hopping, side-stepping, backwards running or leg cross over running preliminary exercises. Following this there is a period of relaxing gymnastic exercise, using the principles of moving from head to the feet in turn. In which Vijay was a good player rather than Ajith.

I took all of the pillows off of the beds, too.  I took the sheets off of the bed and placed them in a laundry basket to take to the laundromat.  After I had taken the old sheets off, I got out the replacements sheets that we keep in our closet.  I took them and stretched them all over the new bed.  I made sure that the bed sheets were very tight so that there wouldn't be any part of them that would come loose.

Maybe this was a hasty decision since I have no experience baking cakes . So I looked online to see what I needed to do . I found a recipe that looked easy enough , so later that day I drove over to the grocery store to buy all the ingredients I would need to bake the cake . When I got to the store I started gathering up everything I needed . Once I almost had everything I turned down an aisle and noticed there were boxed of pre-made cake mix I could buy . This seemed like an easy option , so I put all the ingredients back and bought one of those mixes . I got home and started baking . All I needed to add to the mix was a couple eggs and some vegetable oil . After it was in the oven for an hour the cake was ready . \n",

I got my shirt and pants out and put them on the board. I decided to do the shirt first. Once the iron was heated up, I slowly went over each piece of the shirt. I was careful to stay away from the plastic buttons because I didn't want them to melt. After the shirt was nice looking and wrinkle free, I put it on a hanger. Then, I started ironing my pants. I did the front and back and took extra care around the waist line. Once that was done, I pulled a hanger out and very carefully folded them and placed them on the hanger.

They are known for their variety of steaks cooked to order and a very creative menu of side dishes.  I order my steak, a small filet mignon cooked medium rare.  I also ordered a side of steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes.  I drank water with dinner because I was driving last night.  When my steak arrived I eagerly cut into it expecting it to be cooked exactly as I had ordered.  Instead it was cooked well done, very well done.  I took one bite and I realized that I would have to send it back.  It is really rare that I send food back however this steak was not at all what I had ordered and something that I knew I wouldn't enjoy.  I sent it back and it was replaced quickly with a steak cooked perfectly to my tastes.\n",

I passed the cleaner carefully across each part of the carpet, making sure all the dirt would be sucked up.  When I was finished, I turned the vacuum off.

I began by making a list of all of the different things I would need to bring. This was tricky because where we were going experiences many different types of weather within just a few days span. After I had made a list I went and got my suitcase from the closet and made sure that there was nothing left in it from the last time I used it. I began by packing the shoes that I had decided I would need on the bottom. Next I added my pants and heavier sweaters and sweatshirts. After that I added my shirts and cold weather wear. I ended by packing my socks and belts on the top. I was ready to go on a trip now that I had finished packing my suitcase.\n",

After bringing all of our ingredients home , we followed the recipe instructions closely to ensure we were not doing anything wrong . We put our ingredients together to make sure they were at the right temperature , preheated the oven , and pulled out the proper utensils . We then prepared the batter using eggs and some other materials we purchased and then poured them into a pan . We then put the pan in the oven and baked it according to the instructions . After baking the cake in the oven for the time the recipe told us too , we then double checked to make sure it was done by pushing a knife into the center . We saw some crumbs sticking to the knife when we pulled it out so we knew it was ready to eat ! \n",

I flipped through a magazine , and about five minutes later my name was called . A woman gave me an apron to put on . The apron was to keep water and hair off my clothes during my appointment . She brought me over to a sink and sat me in front of it . The sink has a special notch so you can lean your head back comfortably . She wet my hair and shampooed it , then brought me to my stylist . I sat in a swivel chair in front of a mirror . The chair swivels so the stylist can turn me and reach different areas of my hair . She asked me how I 'd like my hair cut . I told her I 'd like her to cut a few inches off , and to give my hair some layers to fluff it up . She used special extra sharp hair-cutting scissors and cut my hair . Every so often , she - asked me how I liked it so far . When she finished , she gave a mirror to hold and turned the chair around . I was able to hold the mirror in front of my face , and at the same time , see the back of my head in the large mirror . I told her I was happy with the cut . She blew-dry my hair , and added some styling mousse . I gave her a tip , then I paid for the haircut at the front desk . I almost forgot to take off the apron before I left . \n",

My oldest daughter wanted to help me so I had her gather all of our seasonings.  We switched the gas burner to on, and put a little olive oil in the pan.  Once the oil got hot we placed the meat in the pan.  My daughter almost burned herself, so we had to remind her to be really careful.  I gave he the spatula from the counter to move the meat around the pan to heat it evenly.  She sprinkled salt, cumin and cilantro onto the meat.  We continued to give it a couple more pokes with the spatula and removed the pan from the heat.  My daughter shut off the gas switch and we served our meal to our family.  It was delicious.\n",

Planting fruit bearing trees was thought to be a good way to achieve these goals as well as letting the participants learn more about where food sources come from . Research was done into finding trees that would bear fruit in the season that the camp was most used . as well as having the requirements of water and sunlight and soil work with the land at camp . Several trees were ordered , including a cherry tree . In the chosen location a hole was dug and the tree had the burlap removed from the root ball and it was placed in at the appropriate depth . The soil with a few amendments was replaced and grass seed was sprinkled on . The tree was watered as suggested and I was assigned to schedule future watering and monitor the tree for health and insect invasions . \n",

If I'm leaving from home, I usually walk to the station that is nearest to my house.  But, there are so many underground stations, you can almost always get to a station fairly quickly.  Some stations have people working in ticket booths. Riders give the cashier money and the cashier gives the rider a ticket. Other stations have automatic machines where riders can put in the money or use a credit card and a ticket is dispensed.  Once you have a ticket for your chosen destination, you wait for the train to appear.  When the doors open, some riders will disembark.  Once the coast is clear, you can go through the doors to the train and find your seat. Beware, though! You have to be quick! If you move too slow, the train doors may close and you'll have to wait for the next train to get to where you want to go!\n",

Then we gathered together all the things we wanted to take with us, including towels, lunch, drinks, sunblock, sunglasses, plastic pails and shovels, and a beach umbrella. We put everything into the trunk of the car and then we all got into our seats and buckled ourselves in. My dad started the car and backed out of the driveway and then drove for an hour until we reached the beach. We parked in the parking lot and then took everything out of the trunk and carried it across the sand until we found a spot where no other people were sitting. We put everything down, spread out our towels, put up the umbrella, and took off our sandals. Then we all put on sunblock. After that we raced toward the ocean and ran into the water yelling \"Last one in is a rotten egg!\" We played in the water for a long time. Then we got out of the water and went back to our towels.

He prescribed an antibiotic, and said Rory had to take them all, one pill twice a day for ten days. They were such little pills, but Rory just didn't like taking them. I tried washing them down with a whole glass of water, but he said it felt they stuck in his throat, and he was drowning. I tried giving him a pill in a spoon, all covered with applesauce, but he said it tasted terrible. Finally I told him he should decide how to take his pills, and I would watch him take each one, since he needed to take them all. He agreed, and that evening he popped the pill in his own mouth.

Mom gets a load of laundry going while my sister dusts the furniture and I vacuum the carpets. When we all work together, it goes fast and it’s sometimes even fun. Dad scrubs the bathroom and Mom give the kitchen a deep cleaning with all-purpose cleaning spray and a rag. She lets me scrub out the sink and dry it with a soft cloth so it shines. My sister isn’t tall enough to reach to scrub the tub, but Dad lets her scrub and shine the bathroom sink while he cleans the toilet with a long-handled brush.

If I do n't see anything I like , I can use the online catalog to find something that I either need or want . It 's simple to find books on the shelves if I write down the call number and follow the signs directing to that area . Once my book is in hand , I prepare by getting out my library card and heading toward the circulation desk . Some libraries now have self-service checkout areas , while others still require you working with a clerk or librarian to check out . At the self service kiosk , I scan my library card and then scan the bar code on my book . It 's quite simple and helps the line move more quickly than waiting at the circulation desk . Once it is checkout out , I will get a receipt telling me when the book is due and I am free to go home with my book . \n",

I was frustrated , but I decided that I was hungry as well so I made myself a sandwich and cut up some fruit to eat . I took off my dirty clothes and put them in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put down an old blanket on my couch before I sat on it so I would not get it dirty . I watched part of a baseball game until I could not stand my own stench any more . I went to try the water in my bath tub and was extremely glad when it worked .

So I take Saturday of each week to clean my house, in every nook and cranny I clean until it shines. When it comes to cleaning and maintaining my carpet, which I just bought. I take extra care in cleaning it and keeping it clean. I even bought a special vacuum that specializes in vacuuming carpets to look like they are new. When I get to the vacuuming part of my cleaning routine, I take out my vacuum and plug it into the wall. Then I take the vacuum to my carpet and start to vacuum all the area; making sure to not leave any spot. I move the furniture to make sure I vacuum that part of the carpet. I like clean lines and the fresh look vacuuming leaves my carpet so I make sure no to step over what I freshly vacuumed.

That meant that I could paint the walls any color I wanted. We decided to start in the living room. We had picked out a cool gray color for the wall. We began by taping off the window sills and light switches that we did not want to get any paint on. After we were done with that we got our rollers and mixed the paint. My husband poured some paint for me and handed me a roller. I painted the large areas of the wall with the roller, being sure to go in many different directions.

She is watching little Frankie through the baby monitor and is cooking her husbands breakfast as she purees little Frankie's favorite breakfast, which is oatmeal with banana. Just as she stops the blender, she see little Frankie through the monitor awake and ready to call her. She places the breakfasts on the table and heads upstairs to little Frankie's room; where Dad is already holding him to take him downstairs. They head downstairs and Dad seats little Frankie in his high chair. He just started to sit up on his own and he is ready to eat. His face is bright and his chubby cheeks always are smiling. Dad grabs the little spoon and the bowl of Frankie's breakfast and starts making plane noises as he feeds Frankie. Frankie takes one bite of his breakfast and Dad takes a bit of his breakfast, while Mom just watches as she finishes her breakfast. And that's how the morning goes in this family's household.\n",

There were four people going to eat the noodles, so I read the instruction and took out as much of the dry pasta at the instructions stated. I got a pot out of the cupboard. I filled the pot wit one quart of water, put it on the stove and let it boil. Once it had boiled, I put my noodles in. I needed to let them boil in the water for ten minutes, until they were cooked through. I needed to make the meat sauce. I cut up some onions and bell peppers very small. I put some seasoning on some ground hamburger. I cooked the veggies and then added the meat, breaking it apart while it browned. My pasta was done boiling, so I used a strainer to drain it in the sink. Once mt meat and veggies had cooked, I opened a jar of spaghetti sauce and poured it over the meat. I mixed it all together, added some cheese on top, and had a really great family dinner.\n",

We scrolled through Netflix and couldn't find anything that we agreed on, we checked Hulu and couldn't find anything we agreed on so we went to the local Redbox to see what was available. We looked through box machines and finally found something that I had seen but my boyfriend hadn't, I liked it and wanted to see it again so we decided to rent that. I pushed the button for the movie that we wanted to rent and chose that we wanted the regular DVD and not a Blu-ray. I swiped my credit card and entered by zip code onto the screen.

We placed a lot of news papers over the surface of our glass dining room table before eating, but there was still a really big mess when we were done. I removed the papers first, trying and failing to avoid spilling old spice and crab bits on the floor. I threw the dirty newspapers away and Steve tended to the floor. Then I grabbed an old dish towel and used the edge of my hand and a towel to sweep the solid bits off of the table, into my hands. I did this part twice. Finally, when the table was free of anything big pieces of debris, I grabbed the Windex. I sprayed Windex liberally across the table and then used several paper towels to clean the glass. It took a few sweeps to get all the grease off and rid the glass of streak marks, but once it was done it looked very nice.\n",

She checked me in and said the hygienist would be with me shortly. The hygienist is the person you see first, who cleans your teeth with a scraper, flosses them, and sometimes treats them with a pasty substance called fluoride. After the hygienist cleaned my teeth, the dentist came in to see me. He said I had one small cavity, which I normally don't have but ate a lot of sweets the past six months. A cavity can be a little scary, since the dentist goes in with a drill. I was scared it would hurt, but the only thing I felt a little was when the dentist put a needle in my mouth and injected something called Novocaine. After that, it made my mouth go numb, and I didn't feel a thing. Afterwards, I talked funny for a little while, but had healthy and clean teeth again.\n",

I had no idea on how to mow the lawn. My dad showed me that it was very easy to do. First I had to check that the lawn mower had gasoline inside of it. When I checked to see if it has gas I saw that it was very low so my dad helped to put the gas inside the lawn mower. To turn on the lawn mower there was a string that I had to pull and a button I had to push to start the engine. So I pulled and pulled and pulled and then hit the \"on\" button and I could hear a loud sound coming from the lawn mower. All I had to do now was mow so I went up and down the lawn in long lines from one side to the other side of our yard. After I mowed half of our yard I noticed that the lawn mower bag where all the cut grass goes was full so I had to turn off the lawn mover and get a garbage bag. I moved the cut grass from the lawn mower storage bag into the garbage bag until the storage bag was empty again and I started moving again. Up and down the lawn from one side to the other side. After I was done mowing the lawn I still had to use a rake to clean up the rest of the cut grass that the storage bag didn't collect.  So I raked and raked until all of the cut grass was in a garbage bag.  When I finally finished moving the lawn I was able to go to the park to play with my friends.\n",

I started pumping the gas while I listened to the outside music that the gas station was playing. It took around 3 minutes to fill up my car.

First, I gathered all of our plates, utensils, and glasses from the table and walked them over to the sink. I stacked all the dirty dishes up on the counter next to our double sink. Then, I plugged the left side of the sink and turned on the hot water, filling the left side to about half way full as I squeezed in a couple tablespoons worth of dish washing detergent. I placed the dirty dishes into the hot water and grabbed my washing sponge. Using the rough side of the sponge, I selected a plate first, scrubbed it with the sponge, and then rinsed the plate under the tap over the right side of the sink. Once all of the suds were gone, I put the plate in the dish drying rack to dry. I followed these steps with the rest of the dishes moving in order from the plates, to the glasses, and finally the silverware. I let the dishes air dry in the drying rack over night before putting them away in the kitchen cupboards the next morning.\n",

Then I dust, with an old tee shirt that has holes in it. Next I vacuum, paying special attention to the places where people walk the most. I plump up the chair and sofa cushions, and make the bed if it's not already made. Then I do the bathroom. I do the toilet first, with cleanser and a brush. I clean the outside of it too, with a sponge, and around on the floor as well. I scrub out the sink with a scrubbie, and also the tub if it's a problem. I do the mirror with a blue spray product and paper towels, although I know vinegar and water and newspaper works just as well. If I still have time, I wipe down the kitchen counter and stove, wipe out the microwave and scrub the sink. Someday I will wash my windows.\n",

So I went over and asked if she wanted to go out with me. She agreed and we made arrangements to go on our date on Friday night. On Friday, I got all dressed up, got some money out of my savings account, borrowed the car keys from my mother and headed over to Sabrina's house (The girl's name was Sabrina.) I knocked on the door to her family's house and her father opened the door. I identified myself and he let me in. We talked until Sabrina was ready. Sabrina and I had a very nice date. We had a nice dinner then went to a movie. We held hands during the movie. I paid. I took her home and she gave me a hug outside the door of her family home.

This is something that carried over from elementary school, through middle school, and well through high school. Every morning, my dad would wake me up at a specific time. This would always give me enough time to get things done, such as showering, having breakfast, and changing. Making my bed was always the last thing I would do. First, I would take all of the blankets and pillows off of the bed, leaving only the fitted sheet. I would then fix the fitted sheet to where wt evenly covered the whole bed, and tucked it in in the areas where it stuck out. Then, I'd put the normal sheet over it and spread it out evenly to where it looked nice and smooth with no wrinkles. I put the heavy blanket on after this and spread it out evenly. Finally, I'd put the pillows back in their rightful place before heading off to school.\n",

After the pants were off, the smell increased in potency, so I decided to just gut it out and get it done. I took peeled off the straps to the diaper and grabbed her legs, lifting her up and pulling the diaper down. Because it was such a messy poop, I decided to keep her legs suspended in the air with one hand while I reach over to the wipes.

One thing he does a lot are the floors.  he takes floors out that have rotten wood, and rips it out with tools, and it takes time to take out rotten wood.  Once that is up, he lays new wood down in its place, and hammers it down.  He makes it smooth and buffs out any rough edges with a machine that runs across the floor.  Then he takes some polish and seals the floor, to protect the new floor.   Sometimes he has to do this seven or eight times, and it makes the floor protected and shine.  When he is finished, he checks for any cracks or edges that need to be sanded down and repaired.  If there are no mistakes, then he is finished.\n",

Ever since the move Melissa's parents made after she graduated, it had been years since the two had seen one another, and tonight over dinner at Vince's Italian Restaurant, the two old friends would get together once again.  \"Can you pass me the butter please?\" asked Melissa politely.  \"Most certainly, and if you don't mind could you trade me for the Parmesan Cheese?\" asked Adam.

Before I went to the garden, I gathered all the supplies I needed from my garage. I needed gardening gloves, a shovel, a watering can which I filled with water, a bag of soil, fertilizer, and seeds. I then went to the garden and chose a spot to plant my seeds. I had a variety of seeds to choose from, but I decided to try planting basil. I put on the gloves, dug up some dirt using the shovel, placed the seeds in the hole along with the fertilizer, and then placed some fresh soil on top.

To clean the sink, either spray a cleaning product directly into the sink, or put some cleaner mixed with water in a bucket. It is a good idea to wear a rubber glove so the cleaning products don't irritate your skin. Using a sponge, wipe or scrub the sink until you can see that it is clean and rinse it with water. To clean the toilet, put toilet cleaner in the bowl and let it soak for a few minutes. Using a toilet brush, scrub the bowl of the toilet until it looks clean and flush the toilet to get rid of the cleaner. Before cleaning the floor, sweep it to get any dirt off the floor. Then, using some cleaning product mixed with water in a bucket, use a sponge to wipe the floor clean.

I picked up the alarm clock and turned it over, looking at the back and bottom for a place where the batteries go. On the bottom of the clock I saw what looked like a little rectangular door with a latch on one side. I pressed the latch in with my finger, and pulled on it. The little rectangular door came off the clock and underneath I saw two batteries. They said AA on them, so I knew they were double A. I went into the kitchen and found some double A batteries in a drawer. I took them back to the clock, and pulled the old batteries out of the clock. I checked inside the clock where the batteries had been and saw a picture of a battery in each spot where the batteries go. I lined up the bumpy end and flat end of each battery with the picture inside the clock when I put the new batteries in.

However , Supercuts has an option where you can phone in ahead of your arrival and get on the waiting list and apparently several people had done this . After about an hour and a half , I was called back . I sat in a chair and the girl asked me how I wanted my hair cut . I told her that I wanted it cut behind my ears and about two inches off the length all over . She covered me with a plastic sheet up to my neck , took a spray bottle and wet my hair down , combed it through , and began cutting . She started by trimming around my ears so that they were exposed . Next , she took her comb and grabbed a hand full of hair on the top of my head . She combed it straight up with one hand while following the comb with my hair between two fingers of her other hand , stopping about two inches short of the ends . She took her scissors and snipped the top two inches of my hair and then grabbed an adjacent handful of hair and repeated this action . She did this until she had gone over my entire head . During all of this , we chatted about the weather , what kind of food we liked , and some other trivial , but interesting things .

I picked about ten oranges off the trees and put them into the bag.  Then I walked back into the house.  I went into the kitchen and started to peel the rinds off the oranges.  They smelled so good!  I took the fresh oranges and put them into a juicer.  I squeezed as much juice out of the oranges as I was able to.  The juice ran into a clear pitcher.

She answered the door by opening the door and hugging each one of us. She was very happy to see us. She invited us to sit inside and sit on the couch in the living room. She also brought us each slices of pie to eat. We sat and talked together for several hours. We talked about how the other members of the family were doing and about the things that we had been doing lately. We talked about our jobs and about what was going on in our communities.

I made a quick note in my phone to stop at the hardware store on my way home from work to pick up a lightbulb so I could change it when I got back. As soon as I left work, I turned into our local hardware store to buy a bulb. However, upon entering the store, I realized that I had forgotten to check what kind of lightbulb I needed. I wanted to make sure it would fit so that I wouldn't have to return to the hardware store with a bulb that I wasn't going to use. I took a guess and picked out a lightbulb that I thought looked similar to the one I had in my home. I anxiously drove home hoping that I had bought the correct lightbulb. When I took the burnt out lightbulb out of the fixture, I held it up next to the new one I had bought. It was the exact same!

If it smells pretty bad, then it is a poopy diaper. You then take the baby to their changing pad, and expose the diaper from under their clothes. You remove the diaper by pulling on the Velcro straps that are holding it in place. You wrap up the dirty diaper so the waste is contained on the inside and you throw it into the bin. You then wipe the baby's tushy and genitals with a wet wipe. After the area has been wiped, you apply a cream or ointment to the baby's behind. You then take out a fresh diaper, and place it under the baby with the portion with Velcro straps under the behind of the baby. Then fold up the other half and attach the Velcro straps to the front.

After pouring milk in it, turn the heat on at medium heat. If the stove is too hot, the milk will burn at the bottom of the pan. While the milk is heating up, it is necessary to keep on eye on it, and steer from time to time in order to avoid cream to form or milk to stick at the bottom of the pan. Unlike water, when milk starts to boil, it foams a lot and will generally overflow the pan if it is not removed from the heat source. Once the milk has boiled, it is necessary to let it cool down a minute or two so you can remove the cream that forms on top of it.\n",

We walked into the exhibit and began to look at the various displays and pictures posted on the walls. There were so many things to look at, including small models and replicas of concentration camps and gas chambers. Among the most memorable displays were pictures drawn by Jewish children, a huge pile of shoes that were removed when Jews were forced into concentration camps, and a model of a train car that was packed full of Jewish Holocaust victims that were forced to leave their homes and journey to camps. Those who were placed in these cars saw little light and were unable to move for many hours or days at a time. Conditions were very dangerous.

Once the egg appeared to be almost cooked, I flipped the egg with a spatula and cooked the other side. Then I took the English muffin out of the toaster, spread a thin layer of butter on both sides, and placed the egg on one half. I added one slide of cheddar cheese, along with hot sauce and some salt and pepper. I then placed the other half of the English muffin on top of the egg and cheese to form a sandwich.

I ordered a large so I would have extra pizza that I could take to work for lunch tomorrow.  Same Old Place delivers really quickly so they were at my door within about thirty minutes.

First, I went around my flat and made sure there was nothing on the floor.  If there are clothes on the floor, I will put them in a hamper.  If there is paper, I will throw it away.  I sprinkled some nice smelling powder on my carpet to make the room smell good.  Then, I vacuumed my carpet.  Next, I decided to tackle the bathroom.  I put on my gloves and sprayed the whole bathroom with the cleaning spray.  I sprayed everything from the bathtub to my sink.  I took my cleaning brush and scrubbed everyplace that had cleaning spray on it.  I took a my cloth that I had and I polished the places that I had scrubbed.  I sprayed my toilet with cleaning spray and scrubbed it with a different brush that I had.  Lastly, I needed to clean my kitchen.  I took the cleaning spray and sprayed the counter tops and my sink.  I scrubbed each area until it was clean.  After I finished, I washed off my rag and brush.  Thankfully, it didn't take me too long to clean my flat.

The man who delivers the paper drives by my house very early in the morning, while it is still dark outside, and throws it into my yard. Sometime people train their dogs to go out into the yard in the morning and bring the paper back in to them. I have never been able to get my dog to do that. He just did not understand. So I go out in the yard in the morning and get it. I put on my warm robe over my pajamas and put some simple shoes on. Usually, I just wear my house slippers. Then I walk out on the front porch and look for the paper. Usually it's right there in the yard, very close to my front porch. I walk over, pick it up and bring it in, then I can sit down with it and enjoy my morning.\n",

It is a beautiful still life painting of a bouquet of flowers in a vase. It is very colorful, with shades of purple, pink, blue, yellow, and green.

Then I thought about putting up the painting in the living room. I thought this looked much better. I chose a spot on the wall above the couch and then hammered a nail into the wall.

We wandered through the nursery and considered a few of our option . We did n't want a large tree , like a pine tree . We did n't want a small tree , like a Japanese maple . We wanted something in-between . When we spoke to one of the workers at the nursery , he suggested that we plant a crabapple . It would have green leaves , and would have white flowers in the spring . We took the tree home in the back of our truck . My husband used our shovel to dig a hole in the ground . It took him some time - you have to dig a pretty big hole when you plant a tree ! Then I helped him carry the tree over to the hole . We had to cut off the plastic bucket it was in . When we were done , we put it in the hole , and I helped by holding the tree steady and pushing dirt into the hole . Once we had filled in all the dirt around the tree , we turned on the sprinklers .

I looked around to see where it might have gone, and found it in the drawer I keep my pants in. I wondered how I could fix my button. I needed to put the button back on the pants and keep it there. I decided that it would be best to sew the button back on. I got out a needle and some strong thread that was the same color as the pants. I carefully put the thread through the small hole in the needle. I then held the button in place on the pants and put the needle through one of the holes in the button. The needle pushed through into the other side of the pants fabric, and I pushed the needle back through the pants into another hole of the button.

I had to use food to convince them to get into their hit chair, but even once they got into it, I had to seatbelt them in and make sure that they would stay. I then got their food out of the refrigerator and placed it on their table. This was easy, but I also had to make sure the infant ate. He had a difficult time picking up the small foods and I had to serve him the rest with a small spoon.This was a difficult process because he spit up some of it and had a difficult time getting most of it into his mouth.

On the day of my appointment, I drove to my dentist's office. I checked in, confirmed my insurance information, and took a seat and waited for my name to be called. A dental hygienist came out and called my name. I followed him to the back of the dentist's office and he showed me to my room. We began by doing a quick examination of all of my teeth, and he did a small cleaning of them before I was going to be seen by my dentist. He told me that I was due for some x-rays, so we quickly did those before my dentist came in. My dentist entered the room and began looking at my teeth. She informed me that everything looked great and that I should keep cleaning my teeth the way I had been. We finished up the appointment and I left my dentist with a new toothbrush and some dental floss.\n",

When writing a letter, whether it is a physical letter or an email, the first thing to do is address the person you're talking to. I write \"Dear Grandfather\", and then I start writing the body of my letter. I write to him about what I've been up to, and about how I wish we could see each other again. It's very important to use your best writing skills when making a letter, because letters are a very intimate way of keeping in touch with others. Once I'm done writing the letter, I sign it with my name so my grandfather can know it was from me. I wrote a physical letter, so then I need to put it an envelope, address it, and stamp it with postage. All I need to do now is put it in a post box, and wait for Grandpa to mail me back!\n",

I remember that I have a painting in the attic that would look very good on this wall, and bring the painting down from the attic. I think of how the painting would hang on the wall, thinking of different ways it could hang. I think of hanging wire on the pack of the painting's frame to hang on a nail in the wall. This would be a good way to hang the painting, but I do not have any wire. I think of another way to hang it. I remember that I also have some sticky tape I could use, but realize the tape would not be strong enough. I do have some Velcro, which would work well instead of wire and a nail.

When I went to the store I got the biggest and freshest oranges I could find to make sure I could make the sweetest juice. After I got back home I went to the kitchen and got my knife, cutting board, and juicer out. I cut the oranges into slices and put the slices on the top of the juicer. I squeezed the slices as hard as I could so all the juice got in my glass. After I got all the juice I could, I cleaned up the counter and put my big pitcher into the fridge to chill.

Some people also use a thimble to prevent being pricked by the needle and to help push the needle through the clothing. You can choose to match the color of the thread to the button, the clothing, or neither one. First, measure the amount the thread that you think you will need. About 6 inches of thread is probably enough to sew a button. Put one end of the thread through the eye of the needle and pull it through about halfway. Then, tie the two ends of the thread together in a knot. Place the button on the clothing where you want it to be attached. Start by pushing the needle through the back of the clothing and though a buttonhole so that the knot doesn't show. Pull the thread all the way through. Then, push the needle down through the other buttonhole so that the button is secured. Repeat these steps several more times until you think the button is tight and won't become loose.\n",

So, I opened the dishwasher, and let the door fall all the way down.

I placed all of the knives and spoons and forks and spatulas and large spoons in the silverware drawer where they belonged.

I want to make a friend that will be very special to me, someone that I can live with and spend a lot of time with. This kind of friend is the same kind that your mom thinks of your dad. I think about people I know that I would like to become good friends with, and a friendly girl I work with comes to mind. I call her and ask her if she would like to go out on a date. Dates are good to get to know someone, and you might find that you love that person. We decide to go out on a date together, and I pick a good place to go and start to get ready. You want to look good on your date, so I pick out nice clothes to wear. You want to be clean too, so I take a shower and make sure I smell nice.

Koi fish look like big goldfish and they usually live outside in home made ponds.  The person who sold me the house educated me on what kind of food to buy for the fish.  Once I had purchased the proper food I decided to feed the fish.  I measured out the appropriate amount for 6 fish and I walked down to the pond.  I only put a little of the food in at first which is what I had learned is the best way to feed the fish.  After the fish ate the little bit of food that I had given them I added a little bit more.

I use a whole onion, two carrots, two celery stalks, maybe a pound mushrooms, and half a head of red cabbage. I rinse the vegetables, except the onion, and scrub them with a vegetable brush. Then I lay them out on the counter next to my cutting board. I do the onion first, because it can be unpleasant. I peel it, then slice down through the stem end, to make slices that don't go all the way to the root. then I rotate the onion, and cut in the other direction. Then I set the onion on the cutting board and cut it into squares. I peel the carrots, cut them into strips, and cut the strips into squares. I top the celery stalks and cut them into squares too. While I cook those vegetables in oil, I slice the cabbage into flat pieces, and cut each mushroom in half. I put them in with the other vegetables, then drain the soaking water out of the beans and put them in too. I add about nine cups of water, and a few hours later, it's soup!\n",

Ramona helped me untangle my sheets. She helped me put them on too! Ramona is the best, and helps make changing bed sheets a breeze! After I changed the bed sheets, I planned on getting a plan of the future in picture. I made sure to think of the next time I was going to changed the bed sheets. How can I do things better? How can I do things more effectively? What if Ramona isn't around next time to help out? Will I be able to do it on my own? Many questions were circling in my head.

He said that we could so the next day we went to a supply store and bought a can of blue paint. We laid down some tarps on the floor and taped the edges so that paint would not get on things we did not want it on. We also bought some paint rollers and pans to get the job done. After putting on some clothes we did not care about, we started to paint the walls. It took a long time and we opened the windows to let the paint fumes out. It was fairly fun as I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend. Once we finished the room looked so much better. We were very proud of ourselves and cleaned up the mess we left behind.\n",

I also picked up a bag of ice and plastic plates, cups and utensils. The day of the barbecue we set up some folding tables outside and got gas for the grill. I dumped ice into a tub and put in some cans of soda and bottles of beer that we had. When people started arriving we cooked the meat.

First I needed to figure out what day I wanted to leave, and what day I would need to return. I went onto the internet to an airline website. I checked to see if the airline flew from the airport near my home to Alaska. Then I entered the day I wanted to leave and the day I wanted to return. The website showed all of the flights I could take, what time they left the airport and what time they arrived at their destination. I found a flight that would depart the airport near my home in the early morning.  I would switch planes once, and then get to Alaska by early evening. The trip home worked the same way, but in reverse. There were first class and economy seats available on the flight. I decided to book a seat on the flight.

When I wash dishes, I go to the kitchen sink and put the drain plug in the drain hole on the left side to keep the water from going down the drain. I then turn on the faucet to fill the sink with water. I turn the faucet so that I have pretty hot water coming out. As the water starts to fill the sink, I put in some dish detergent that I have in a plastic bottle. I squeeze out about a quarter's size of detergent. I swish the detergent in the sink to help it dissolve and get foamy and sudsy. After the sink is mostly full, I put all the dishes that are dirty in the sink. I start to wash and clean the dishes with a kitchen sponge. I wipe each dish, one by one, until it is completely clean. Then I place it on the right side of the sink that is empty. I continue this way until all the dishes are cleaned. Then I pull out the plug and let the sudsy water go down the drain. After I do this, I start to rinse all the soapy dishes with cool water from the faucet until they don't have any suds on them anymore. As I rinse each one, I put them into a dish drainer that is right next to the sink. That way they can dry and be used again.\n",

Mom also puts a bib on him so his clothes will be protected from any spilled food. Mom takes the tiny rubber spoon for feeding the baby out of the drawer and opens the baby food jar.

Next, we started a pot of water on the stove and set it to high. We cut the hot dog pouch open and placed 2 hot dogs into the water. We let them boil while we gathered the other items. We got a plate and put 2 hot dog buns on it. He put a squirt of ketchup down each one. We took the hot dogs out of the water with a fork, being careful. He placed one on each bun.

I turned to my wife and asked \"what did you feed her yesterday?\" She said \" All kinds of good stuff, and either way; it's your turn to change her. I did it all day yesterday and the day before.\"  I groaned and complied. I picked our precious little stinky up and laid her on the couch while my wife spread out a changing blanket underneath her, and brought over a fresh diaper and box of baby butt wipes. Holding my breath I opened the front straps of the diaper and attempted to fold the diaper shut while wiping front to back with my right hand while holding her butt up by her feet in my left hand. I set the diaper on the floor, grabbed some wipes and wiped her clean from front to back using only 3 wipes. I set her down and slide the back of a fresh diaper underneath her bum, folded the front over her and velcroed those straps on. I rolled up the dirty diaper strapped it shut and tossed it into the diaper genie. I put her clothes back on and she was all set to crawl around and chase the cat some more.\n",

Katelyn, my aunt, and my uncle were all visiting our house from out of town, but my aunt and uncle were out running errands when Katelyn started to get a fever. I noticed that her forehead felt warm, which made sense since she was acting somewhat cranky. I decided that I needed to get Katelyn some medicine. So, I went to our medicine cupboard, which is in our bathroom. I picked out some children's medicine that helps reduce fever symptoms. I looked at the instructions on the bottle. Katelyn is still pretty young in age, so I didn't want to give her too much medication. The instructions said that a teaspoon of the medication would be enough. I called Katelyn over, poured some of the medicine out into a measuring spoon, and fed it to her. She didn't like the taste, so I gave her a glass of water to wash it down afterward.

Every day I go around and collect all of the dirty clothes from the bedrooms and bathrooms and pile it all up outside the laundry closet (it isn't big enough to be called a laundry room.) I separate the clothes into their various loads; underwear all goes into one pile, towels and wash rags go into another piles, jeans go into yet another pile and all the shirts go into another pile. I do the machine according to the directions on the machine. I turn it on and let it start filling with water. I wait  until the entire bottom is filled with water then I pour in the proper amount of detergent. Only then do I start loading in the clothes. I usually do it one article of clothing at a time, moving around the drum so the load stays balanced. Once it's full, I simply close the door and let it run. It does all the work. When it stops, you take the clothes out and move them to the dryer.\n",

I started browsing through all the search results until a book caught my eye . I noted down the shelf number it should be in and went over to it .

Looking down in horror I realized my toddler had spilled milk everywhere. Grabbing the towel I have hanging from the oven door, I was able to step on that to then reach paper towels. Leaning down, I slowly mopped up the mess with the towels. Once it was good enough, I then grabbed my mop and the mop bucket. From the kitchen sink I filled the bucket and added a little soap. Dunking the mop in the bucket and then moving it across the floor to pick up any remaining mess. No one likes the smell of spoiled milk! Once done, I emptied the bucket and hung the mop up to dry.

I listened carefully to the flight attendant as she gave her speech about safety precautions . After she finished the pilot got on the loud speaker and informed us that we will be taking off shortly . He told us what time we will be landing in Florida and even the temperature it will be when we landed . He then told us to buckle our seat belt and turn off any electronic devices we may have with us . A couple minutes later the engine came to life and the plane started moving towards the runway . When it reach the runway it started to speed up very fast and after a minute I felt the plane lift off of the ground . I looked out the window and saw us leaving the ground .

We went into the kitchen and removed all of the old , worn out tile from the floor.  We then sanded down the floor and prepared it to receive the new tile.  After this, we took a trip to the Home Depot to pick out exactly what new tile I wanted.  I decided I wanted a bright white tile to match the refrigerator in the kitchen.  After buying enough tile to cover the entire floor, we went back to my house.  Slowly, tile by tile, we put industrial glue on the bottom of each tile and carefully set it into a neat pattern on the floor.  We did this until the entire floor of the kitchen was covered, and then put rubber strips around the outer wall.  Finally we, left to let it sit and dry for the day.\n",

We had rice with Spanish green peas, a roasted pork shoulder, baked ziti, banana pudding and chocolate cake. All of that food was homemade and it was Delicious. So i had a lot of pots and pans to wash with plates and cups. I sort out the dirty dishes into piles such as plates, cups, pots and pans. i like to use dawn soap i feel like it gets everything much cleaner. I use hot water and a scrubber to clean the dishes and put them in the dish rack to start to dry. Then i start to wash the cups and silverware and put them in the dish rack to dry. So by the time i wash the pots and pans, the first set of dishes would be dry so i can put those away and the pots and pans would fit in the dish rack to dry properly.\n",

Since I liked the movie , I wanted to read the book and went to the library in my neighborhood to see if they had it . In the library the books were separated into fiction and non-fiction areas . Since the story was about something that happened in real life , it would be in the non-fiction area . If it were a make-believe story , it would have been in the fiction section . The person who wrote the book had a last name that began with S. I began looking on the shelves for authors with the last name that began with S. All the books were in alphabetical order according to the authors last name . I found the book I was looking for and took it off the shelf . I brought it to the desk where the librarian was and gave her the book . She asked me for my library card , which gives me permission to borrow books . She entered my information into her computer so she would know who borrowed the book . She told me the book would be due back in the library in two weeks . If I did n't bring it back by then , I would have to pay the library money for every day the book was late . I did n't want to have any late fees , so I made sure I brought it back on time . Since the book belonged to the library , I took good care of it so others could enjoy the book when they borrowed it . \n",

As soon as I make sure I have my ingredients, I go to the cupboard and take out the frying pan and mixing bowl. Once I have the mixing bowl I smile instantly knowing it is now time to crack the eggs into the bowl and mix them up with a little bit of milk. My mouth is watering as I now pour the mixture into the frying pan. The sizzling of the eggs as they cook is heaven to my ears. What  I usually do is let them cook on one side for a couple of minutes then I will break the eggs up with a fork and let them finish cooking for a couple more minutes. Ding ding!

Then we bought the coal and the things to burn the coal such as lighter. We shopped the sticks, oil and a brush to apply the oil. In the previous day of the party, we shopped meat. As we had plan for preparing prawn sticks too, we bought prawn. Few hours before, we marinated meat and prawn. During party, few of our friends ignited the coal and few of us arranged meat and prawn on sticks. We inserted capsicum, tomato and onion in between the meat to add flavor. Once the coal was ready, we placed the sticks on the stove and started cooking. We had to turn the sticks continuously to avoid the meat get burned. Once the meat and prawn got well cooked, we enjoy them with mayonnaise. It was a good party.\n",

While making Billy a snack in the kitchen, his grandmother clinched her chest, turned a sickly shade of gray, farted, and collapsed. Billy was only 7 years old so he was scared, but he knew what to do. He picked up the phone and dialed 9 1 1. When the operator answered she said, “911. What's the nature of your emergency?\" Billy started crying and couldn't speak. The operator told him in a calm, professional voice to tell her what was wrong so that they could quickly help. Billy stopped crying and explained what had happened to his grandmother. The operator asked Billy his name and address. He told her. “Now Billy,” the operator said, “An ambulance is on its way. Is your front door unlocked?” Billy said that it was. “Billy, is your grandmother breathing? I need you to check. Can you do that for me?” Billy saw that his grandmother's chest was going up and down and that she was quietly moaning. Billy told the operator this. “Good job. Billy. When the paramedics, that's the ambulance crew, getting there I want you to help them save your grandmother, Ok?” Billy said that he would.

He offered to clean it, but I told him he should rest and I'd do it and then grabbed the shower cleaning solvents from under the bathroom sink. First I used the detachable shower head to rinse the grit down the drain. Afterwards, I sprayed a foaming antibacterial cleanser on the walls, in the corners and on the shower's glass door. I let the cleaner sit for a little while, so it could really soak into the dirty surfaces. Then I went in with a sponge and scrubbed every inch with the rough, scrubby part of the sponge. Once I was satisfied I'd gotten most of the dirt out, I put the shower on extra hot and rinsed down the walls. The last step was glass cleaner and a squeegee, to make sure the door was as spotless as the rest of the shower. It took me over an hour, but I was happy with the result.\n",

We arrived at the store in the early afternoon , and the first thing we did was get a shopping cart . We walked in and went to the produce area first , where all the fruit and vegetables are . My husband checked the list . We only had bananas on the list , but I said we should get things for salad , too , so he picked out bananas and bell peppers while I got lettuce and radishes and tomatoes . Then we went to the deli area and ordered some sliced turkey . The man behind the counter sliced the turkey for us and measured it on a scale to give us the amount we wanted , then wrapped it up for us . Next we visited the bakery area and picked out a nice loaf of rye bread to put the turkey on . In the canned goods area , we picked out soup and white beans ; then we went to the pasta area to get pasta and sauce . In the meat area , we picked up some chicken breasts and Italian sausage . Then we went to the dairy refrigerators and we each picked out some flavors of yogurt we like , and got milk and butter and eggs . We were nearly done , so my husband checked the list again and we saw we had forgotten tin foil and toilet paper , so we went back and got those two things . Then we went to the check-out where we put all our groceries on a conveyor belt and the clerk scanned each item in an electronic scanner to find out what it cost . She told us the total , and I swiped my bank card through an electronic reader to pay . Meanwhile , a bagger was putting our groceries into re-usable shopping bags that we had brought with us . He put the bags back into the cart . We got a receipt from the clerk and pushed the cart out to our car , where we moved the bags into the back seat . Then my husband put the cart in little corral in the parking lot that keeps the carts away from people 's cars , and we got in our car and went home . \n",

While they were changing I packed a bag with some snacks, their pool toys, towels and sunscreen. The kids came down and I put on their sunscreen, because I knew if I waited they would be too excited and jump in the pool with out it. We drove to the pool and went in and found three chairs and placed our towels on each one. The kids grabbed their pool toys and started running to the water. The lifeguard blew his whistle to remind them that it was not safe to run near the pool. We spent the day enjoying the water and the sun.

Then, we gathered branches and logs to place into the fire pit.  We stacked the wood in the fire pit and carefully placed dry leaves and a brush in between the logs.  Then, we lit a match and started the dry leaves on fire, hoping that the logs would catch fire too.  I blew on the fire just a little bit to help it grow.  The embers glowed a brilliant orange and soon, the fire caught and we were getting toasty warm!  Once the fire was started, we all sat around it and warmed up.  I brought marshmallows for us to have as a snack.  We each took turns roasting the marshmallows over the fire.  It was a really fun night!\n",

I wanted to wear that shirt to work so I quickly pulled my sewing kit out of the closet and got to work. I detached the button from my shirt and took out the old thread. I got a new piece of thread out of my sewing kit and weaved it through the eye in the needle. I tied a knot and began to work my needle and thread through my shirt. I then added on the button and weaved the needle through the holes in my button. I went through each hole in the button about five times to make sure it was secure. Once I was confident the button wouldn't fall off, I tied off the string and cut it. My button was securely attached to my shirt. I buttoned it through the whole and left for work.\n",

This morning, it was really cold out, so I unlocked my car, got inside, and turned on the ignition, by putting the key in and turning. Since it was so cold, I let the car warm up a little bit before I drove it. The heat came on and it got warm again.

I remembered the special class at school about calling 911 in an emergency, so I called 911.  A very nice lady answered the phone, asked me my name and why I was calling.  I told her that my mom was choking and turning blue and we needed help.  The nice lady, her name was Mary, asked me how old I was and if I knew my address.  I felt stupid because I could only remember the street name and the city I lived in, but Mary said to calm down and she would help me.  Some how she found out exactly where we lived and told me the ambulance was on its way.  Mary told me to stay near my mom until the ambulance came and open the door for them as soon as I saw the lights, so I did.  Luckily the men from the ambulance squeezed my mom real tight from behind and she spit up the food she was choking on, it was gross.

Next, you can search for the item that you desire to purchase. There are so many things available to buy online! Clothing, games, toys, gift cards, all of it is available to order from home by using online shopping. There are many websites to choose from, but try and find one that you like and trust, after all you will be providing information like your address and credit card information. I really love Amazon. If I think of a product I need or want (like shoes for example) I just click on the Amazon app, use the search bar and type in the product I am looking for.

I pulled the fitted sheet down on all four corners so it was no longer sliding off the mattress. I straightened the pillowcases so the pillows were inside them fully, I fluffed them up a bit and I propped them all at the head of the bed, 2 on each side. I was able to pull up the sheet and comforter at the same time and I pulled it halfway up over the pillows. I noticed that the the bottom of the sheet had come untucked and was loose and hanging out so I tucked it between the mattress and box spring so I could no longer see it out. I finished by smoothing the comforter out so it looked neat and not wrinkled.\n",

The receptionist asked me my name and input it into her computer.  The receptionist asked to see my driver's license and insurance card, and then asked me to pay my copay, which was $15.  After that, the receptionist asked me to take a seat waiting room.  I waited, and after a few minutes, a medical assistant called my name so I went with her into the exam room.  The assistant measured my height, weight, temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and I responded to her questions about why I was there and what medications I take.  After inputting the data into a computer she left and I waited in the exam room until the doctor arrived.  The doctor asked me some more questions, which I answered.  The doctor then looked into my eyes, ears, and throat with a bright light and felt my glands on my throat and neck.  The doctor listened to my heart and my breathing through a stethoscope.  After looking at data in the computer, the doctor said that I did not need a prescription, and that I should treat my sore throat with rest, lots of liquids, and an over-the-counter pain and fever reliever.  After that, both the doctor and I left the exam room, and I went home and followed the doctor's advice to rest, drink liquids, and take an over-the-counter pain killer/fever reliever.\n",

Each night I put his toys away before he goes to bed. Sometimes we make a game out of it, seeing how quickly we can get all his toys into his toy box. Yesterday, his favorite toys to play with were cars. He had at least 30 different cars spread around the house, so I had to watch where I walked as I was cleaning up his toys. Soon, Alex will be big enough to be able to put away his toys all on his own. Until then, I clean them for him, and he enjoys himself all day playing with his many toys. It makes me happy knowing he has so much fun taking all his toys out and playing with them.\n",

The hardest part about making a vegetable stew is all of the vegetables that you have to chop. So I got out all of the vegetables that I wanted to put into the stew and went ahead and washed it all. I also got out my cutting board and one of our sharpened knives. Sharp knives always make chopping vegetables very easy. I started with the celery and cut it up into small bite sized pieces. When I was done I moved the cut up celery to the side and moved on to the carrots. I chopped them in half, then down the long way until I was through. I moved them and chopped up the onions and potatoes. Pretty soon I was through chopping the vegetables.\n",

I found it behind the sugar canister and set it by the oranges.  I got out my bread board and found my large chef knife in the knife rack.  I took the oranges to the sink and washed all the oranges.  I then began to cut all of the oranges in half.  After the oranges were all cut, I started to twist the oranges on the top of the juicer.

She stood on it while it was on the ground and jumped around for a bit, and started to giggle.  After she got off we spread the sheet out over the mattress and folded each corner over the corner of the mattress and put the mattress back into her crib.  We took the pillow case and opened the side up.  She held the pillow case while I stuffed the pillow inside.  Once we placed the pillow back in the crib, we spread her blanket over the mattress and tucked the sides into the bed.\n",

I fill my pot with salty water and set it to boil. While I wait for it to boil, I get the meat sauce started. I brown some ground meat in my pan until it's fully cooked, and then add some tomato sauce to make my sauce. Now the water's boiling, so I put in my spaghetti and wait for it to boil. I add spices to my sauce to make it taste good, like oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Once the spaghetti is cooked, I strain it with a strainer and add it right to the sauce. Then, I add a few handfuls of mozzarella and parmesan cheese, so my sauce is extra cheesy. I let it cook on the pan a little more, and it's ready to eat!\n",

He placed his white shirt on the board, sprayed the shirt with water, and then pressed the iron on the shirt. He switched off between spraying with water and pressing with the iron. The whole thing took him about five minutes. Mark decided to just iron this one shirt so he could put it on and leave the house quickly.

That included a plastic cover for the table, paper plates, plastic cups, plastic utensils, napkins, aluminum foil and plastic bags that would be used for garbage and taking things back home. Next I needed to set up the cooler, which included bottles of water, soda and juice to keep everyone hydrated. Then I needed to ensure that we had all the food we intended to bring or cook. So at home, I prepared baked beans, green beans and macaroni and cheese. These foods were put into separate aluminum containers, and covered with aluminum fall so they could be transported to the picnic area and ready to be served. But in a cooler, I packed chicken, hotdogs, hamburgers  and rots that were to be cooked on the grill once we were at the picnic location. Along with those meats, I carried my seasonings such as socks, pepper and garlic, cooking utensils for the grill, charcoal and lighter fluid the only thing left to consider was the entertainment, and which case I packed a boombox, an extra set of batteries and a few of my favorite CD's so that we would have music to listen to while at the picnic.\n",

I head over to the living room and the lamp next to my desk. The bulb is still hot, I need some towel to grab it and unscrew it. I head into kitchen to get the towel, and then I change out the light bulb. But this one is so much brighter than the old one that went out. I look at the box and the label says 150W.

I had many options such as black tea, green tea, and white tea. I chose to drink green tea this morning. I opened the tea package and grabbed a tea bag. Approximately fifteen minutes after I put the water on the stove to get warm the water was boiling hot which is perfect for making tea. I removed the teapot from the stove. I reached into my cupboard and grabbed a mug to pour the hot water in. I poured the steaming hot water in the mug and placed the teapot back on the stove but on a cooler burner this time.

I feed my cat dry food, but there is wet food that comes in a can too. I go get the bag of food and measure out how much to give to my cat. It's important to measure out your pets' food, because overfeeding them can make them sick. Then, I pour the measured food into the dish. The sound of the food being poured sends my cat running! From anywhere in the house, she'll dash over to the kitchen and start eating. While she eats, I take her water dish and fill it up with clean water.

Taking off the rest of my clothes and putting them in the hamper took only a few seconds. Stepping in the warm shower instantly relaxed me. I wet my hair and body.

After working the soap fully through my hair, I rinsed it all out under the shower spray until all the bubbles were gone from my hair. I made sure all of the soap was completely out of my hair before I applied the conditioner. It smelled much like the shampoo, and filled the shower with a nice smell.

After everyone ate, my mom asked me to clear the table. I was excited because she was giving me my own chore to do by myself. First I collected all the empty dishes and put them in the sink. Not all the plates were empty so I took a spoon and emptied all the leftover food in the trash. My mom always reminds me to do that before putting the dish in the sink because she says leftover food will clog up the dish drain. Then I gathered all the utensils we used and put them in the sink too. I put all the used glasses and cups on the counter near the sink. Mom says not to put them inside the sink with the other dishes because they can easily break. Once all  the dishes were away, I wiped the table off with a wet cloth.

As I did not want to incur in any fees for late payment, I decided to pay it right away. The letter said I could make payment over the phone, so I dialed the number printed in the letter. After a few seconds, the Electric Company answered my call asking how they could help me. I said I wanted to pay my bill, so the agent asked a few information about me in order to verify my account. Once the agent found my name, my address and my account number in their computer, they asked my credit card information to complete the payment of 50$. I gave the agent all the info he needed and after a few seconds he told me that the payment went through and my balance was 0. He also gave me a confirmation number to prove that I had paid my bill.

I scroll down through the results and choose my favorite 3 bikes. I open these options in new tabs and compare and contrast the reviews, features, and appearances of the bikes. Finally, I settle on one. I add this bike to my cart, proceed to checkout, enter my payment information and address. I then confirm my order and wait 5-7 business days until it arrives.\n",

Since I only needed 1 bulb I pulled it out and put the package back. Then I set up the step ladder because I'm too short to reach the ceiling. I placed the bulb on the back shelf along with a paper towel. Of course, I made sure the light switch was off so I would not be shocked. I climbed the ladder and carefully unscrewed the cover, setting it down on the back shelf. I unscrewed the bulb, and set it down, too. The new bulb screwed in easily. I wiped the cover with my towel and screwed it back, as well. I climbed down the ladder, put it away and disposed of the bulb and towel.When I flipped the switch the bulb came on without a flicker.\n",

We see online that the prices are fair for the plane tickets and the stay at a resort. The trip would probably take someplace during the end of the year holidays, most likely around Christmas time or Thanksgiving. We need to save up money. My girlfriend plans to keep working. I plan on doing extra work on Saturdays to save up. This will allow us to pay for the trip without having to tap into our savings account. Next, we need to make arrangements for our pets. After that, we should decide on a date and start planning our activities there. The last thing is probably to book the tickets for the flight and hotel. We can't wait to go to Mexico!\n",

There was a little bit of traffic, but it didn't take long to get to the club. Once we arrived, he parked the car, and we got out to stand in line. After waiting about twenty minutes, we reached the front of the line. We showed the bouncer our ID's, and he waved us through. My boyfriend paid $20 for each of us and we walked inside. The club was very crowded. We navigated our way through the crowd of people until we got to the middle of the dance floor. The DJ was playing a great song, so we started dancing. After about five or six songs, I was ready for a break, so my boyfriend and I walked to the bar to get some drinks. He paid for the drinks, and we took them over to a small loveseat in the corner. We talked and laughed while we finished our drinks. When we were done, we set our drinks down on the table and got up to dance some more. We danced for a few  hours until we were tired, and then he drove me back home. It was a really fun night.\n",

The teacher has told us that we must listen to the rules, but since it's a hands on museum, we can touch and play with so many things.  My friend Janet and I are so excited to be paired up as a buddy together.  We are assigned to a group of 4 girls and Janet's mom.  Janet's mom is our chaperone, so she is in charge of the four of us.  As we enter the museum we see so many weird and wonderful things.   There is a bed of nails that we can lay on.  Janet is too scared, but I lay on it and it doesn't even hurt.  Then we play in a maze that show us how scientist train mice to do hard task like remember how to escape mazes. Right before lunch, we meet up with the rest of our class and watch a science demonstration about air, and how it really takes up space.  The Scientist had a homemade air cannon out of a garbage can and saran wrap and when he beat the back of it, air blasted us right in the face.  My hair went flying.   We ate lunch with our group at the cafeteria, and it was so loud because everyone was very excited about our field trip.  Janet's mom took us to the ocean exhibit next.  We were able to pet a starfish and a horseshoe crab in the touch tank, and watched otters playing in a nearby exhibit.  The day ended with us loading on to the bus and heading back to school.  It was a lot of fun.\n",

They also dress in suits and nice clothes because it's respectful. Before the funeral the dead person is kept at a funeral home. There they dress them in a nice outfit and put them in a coffin. The coffin is put into a hearse, which is a big car designed specially to carry coffins. Hearses drive very slowly, and other cars wait for them to go past and don't rush them. The hearse will drive to the home of the dead person. There the person's family will get into another car behind the hearse and drive to the church where the funeral is being held. Six ushers carry the coffin into the church. The coffin goes at the front of the church by the vicar. The family site closest to the front, and friends at the back. The vicar says nice things about the dead person. The users then take the coffin outside to the grave, which has already been dug. There the vicar says more nice things while the coffin is lowered into the grave. Sometimes people throw small bits of dirt onto the coffin, as a way of starting to bury it. Afterwards people go back to the dead person's house to eat food and say nice things about the dead person to their family.\n",

In my garden, I grow tomatoes, zucchini, spaghetti squash, and some other delicious vegetables. I went out to the garden and quickly noticed that it looked like a squirrel had done some digging in my garden and had eaten a few of my plants. I was sad, but the squirrel didn't get everything, so I still had quite a few things left. I ripped out the plants that the squirrel had gotten into since they were dirty, and got to work pruning the rest of my garden. I pulled out some weeds, straightened up some of my plants that had begun to fall over, and finished by watering my garden. I checked my tomato plant before I went inside to see if any were ripe enough for me to pick. I found two perfect and ripe tomatoes that I brought inside to cook with dinner that evening.\n",

I had been washing and drying clothes for most of the day so now it was time to catch up on the ironing so that I could get them all put away. I filled the iron with water and turned it on to heat up and set it upright on the ironing board. While the iron was heating I put another load of clothes into the dryer and one into the washing machine. The laundry was getting done quick so the ironing needed to be done quickly as well. Next I grabbed the first shirt out of the basket of clothes and neatly spread it out on the ironing board. I picked up the iron and moved it over the shirt, sort of slowly, but not slow enough to burn the shirt. After the shirt was flat and there were no more wrinkles I moved it to a different position, where there were more wrinkles, and repeated the same steps. I did this until the whole shirt was ironed and there were no more wrinkles. I did this with each piece of clothing until the basket was empty then I put them all away, neatly where they went. I ironed all of the clothes that needed to be ironed until all of the laundry was done, folded, and put away. I usually only iron certain clothes, most people do, mostly dress shirts and khakis and things like that. I don't much iron cotton tees or blue jeans, though some people do.

I hadn't seen her in a while so I decided to get together with some other friends and throw her a going away party. We purchased a lot of alcohol from the local liquor store, lots of nostalgic stuff we used to drink years ago. I also bought some streamers and helium balloons, I know it seems festive for a depressing event, but helium balloons can be fun. We also reassembled the stone fire pit in her back yard and collected fire wood from the nearby forest. The night of the party we picked up hot dogs, hamburger, and stuff to make macaroni and potato salads. We all drove to her house and each began on a different task.

First, I take the empty dishes, plates, glasses, or bowls off of the table and put them in the kitchen sink to be washed or else I put them directly into the dishwasher. Sometimes I have to make two trips to the kitchen, depending on how many dishes there are on the table. I sometimes stack them in my hands so I can carry more, but then I have to be extra careful. Since there are usually crumbs on the table after a meal, I take a dry cloth and wipe them off of the table into my hand and put them in the garbage can. Then I use a damp sponge or dishcloth to wipe off the table in case any food or drinks were spilled. I wait for the table to dry and then sometimes spray furniture polish on it and wipe if off with a dry cloth, so that the table is protected for next time.\n",

John would start by asking his mom and dad what they wanted, and sometimes it was just cereal and toast. But last Saturday, their mom and dad wanted pancakes.  So, John and Melissa went into the kitchen, and got a big bowl out of the cupboard.  They poured the pancake mix into the bowl, and put in one cup of water , as the directions said on the back of the box.  It made a nice pancake mix. Next, Melissa went into the refrigerator, and grabbed some blueberries.  She put a cup of blueberries into the mix, and stirred the mix up.  John's job was to scoop one whole ladle full of pancake mix and pour it into the griddle .  He was good at pouring the pancakes and making them round.  Once John cooked them on one side, he would flip them for the other side to be cooked.  Then, he placed them on the plates for breakfast.  They were great!\n",

I went to my desk and picked up a blank sheet of paper and a pen. I started by writing the date in the top right corner of the page, and I wrote \"Dear Grandma,\" on the left side of the first line. Below that, I wrote about what I was being taught in school, and I told her all about my new dog, Pickles. At the end of the letter, I asked her about her gardening and to please write me back very soon. I ended the letter by signing \"With Love, Samantha\" at the bottom. I proceeded to place the letter in an envelope and wrote her address and the return address. I placed a stamp on the envelope and placed it in the outgoing mail.\n",

We had received an invitation to go a few weeks ago and took that invitation with us to find the church to go to.  My wife came along and we dressed nice for the occasion.  When we arrived, we entered the holy place and waited for the couple to arrive.  They looked great together and went up to the altar.  The elder gave them some great advice and told them that their marriage would be eternal.   He than told them their promises they would make to each other and asked them if they would live those promises.  The man and woman agreed and they kissed over the altar to seal the deal.

We went online to and checked out different travel sites for hotels near New York City. We decided on New York because I had never been west of Boston. After a few days of searching we decided on a hotel in Pennsylvania. Once the hotel booking was complete it was time to set aside some gas money and rent a car through his work. He called the car rental place and realized he got a great work discount. We scheduled to pick up the car a week from that day. During the week we slowly packed clothes and personal items. We also tried to eat items in the refrigerator that would otherwise perish. We also packed ready made foods and drinks to bring with us on the trip. We planned routes and travel time, and had change in the car to pay all the tolls we would encounter. Pit stops were all accounted for as well.\n",

I was at home, so I took her into her bedroom where the changing table was, and laid her down on the table. I unsnapped her onesie and pulled it up, and then opened her diaper and pulled it off, setting it to the side. I then took her cleaning wipes and wiped her clean, making sure to get into all the cracks and crevices. Once she was clean, I wiped her dry with a towel, and then put on her diaper cream on some red spots so they wouldn't become sore. After that, I took out a new diaper, put it under her, and did up the fasteners, making sure that it was on snugly but comfortably.

Everyone has places they remember as a child or traditional family places with memories tied to them. If nobody wants to go, I'll go by myself. There's a wonderful place not too far away with miles of waterfalls and wading pools. It's a great place to go. All I really need for supplies is a tent, a lighter, newspaper, some booze, blankets, pillows, phone, flashlight and food. Well, I might also need hygiene products, a fishing pole, extra clothes and towels. I find that making a check list a few days ahead of time will help to remind me of and not forget anything important. Once arriving at the destination, the hardest part is setting up the tent. Starting a fire is easy, just need some sticks, newspaper and a lighter. I usually spend the day hiking, fishing and swimming.\n",

I packed a bag with some sun tan lotion and towels and a few bottles of water.  Then we got in the car.  It was only a short drive to his house and they were waiting in the water for us.  I set down my bag on one of the chairs and took off my tee shirt and shorts.  I found the sunscreen in my bag and rubbed some into my skin.  My boyfriend helped me get my back.

I own 3 different rackets, all different colors, and like to experiment with each one. My neighbor Bill, who enjoys tennis as much as me, usually meets me on Tuesday afternoons for a few quick matches. We start by warming up before we get into playing with each other. One of us starts by serving the ball to the other person and waiting for a return hit. The ball goes back and forth until someone misses a shot, or the ball goes out of bounds. The person who served gets the points and the person returning gets the ball to serve if they win. Bill has been playing for about 10 years longer than me, so he usually ends up winning. I find the game fun and a good way to exercise.\n",

I got out of my clothes and turned the water in the shower on. I adjusted the temperature of the water until it was comfortable for me, then I stepped into the shower. I got my hair wet by standing under the shower head and the water. Once my hair was wet, I reached over to grab a bottle of shampoo, opened it, poured some into my hand, then set the bottle back down. Then I rubbed the shampoo between both of my hands to work up a little lather. After that, I placed my hands in my hair at my scalp and slowly massaged the shampoo into my hair and scalp. I worked the lather down my hair from my roots to my ends. After my hair was fully lathered and clean, I put my head back under the water spray and began rinsing the bubbles and lather from my hair. I used my hands to help push the shampoo out of my hair, and I moved my fingers over the top of my head back to the bottom of my hair to make sure that all of the shampoo was rinsed out.

We went to the store to find some things to hang on our walls to make it feel more homey. We found a nice painting that would look good in our dining room. When we got home my husband found his nails and hammer. I got out our new level and we picked out exactly where we wanted to hang it. We measured carefully to ensure that it would be centered on the wall and marked the spot with a pencil so that we would remember where to drive the nail.

When I entered the library , I saw hundreds of books on many different shelves and was not sure where to find books on tigers . I asked a librarian for help finding books on tigers . Are you looking for stories about tigers , or facts and photographs about tigers ? she asked me . I told her I wanted facts and real information so I can write a report . She walked over to a group of shelves labeled Nonfiction and told me that these books all had true facts and pictures , rather than being imaginary stories . They are put in a special order using number codes called the Dewey Decimal System . Using these codes , all the books on tigers would be in the same place and would be very close to books about other animals . She looked up the Dewey Decimal System code for tigers and wrote it down for me . Walking through the shelves with my code , I saw that the numbers on the spines of the books start at zero and keep getting bigger and bigger . Finally , I was getting close to the number she wrote down for me . There I saw books about lions , cheetahs , and finally tigers . I found a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian . She asked me for my library card , and after I handed it to her , she scanned it with her computer . Next , she scanned a bar code on the back of the book . Now the book was checked out in my name so that the library would know who has the book . She handed me the book and told me that I needed to bring it back to the library in two weeks . If I did n't bring it back , I would have to pay a fine for every day I kept it , because other people might want to read the book too . I thanked her and went home to work on my report . \n",

I turned on the heat under the pan to medium heat and let the butter melt, swirling it around to coat the pan.

There were quite a lot of them , so it took me a while to narrow down my choices based on when I wanted to leave and then arrive at my vacation destination . I finally was able to choose a time and date , and I purchased my tickets with my credit card . The day finally arrived to take my vacation . I went to the train station and checked in with the railway . They gave me a paper ticket , which I then brought to the rail line . When we boarded the train , we gave the ticket to a ticket taker , and he escorted me to my booth . It was fun and exciting . Finally after all the passengers were on board , we were off . The train seemed a bit jerky in the motion , but eventually it smoothed out . It was so much fun , seeing all of the towns and cities we passed through . Some we stopped at and some we just passed through . People would get on and off when we stopped . I was able to purchase some food in a car that sold sandwiches . I slept some in my car , which was a bit uncomfortable , but I did n't mind . Before I knew it , we had arrived at my vacation destination .

She separated out the whites from the colored laundry, making two surprisingly big piles on her laundry room floor. She got down the new laundry detergent she had found for her nifty new high efficiency washer. She had been so happy with the new washer because while she did regular laundry in the top, down below she could do a load of delicates at the same time. She popped two of the new pods in the washer and put the setting for the white load on hold, just putting a little water in the machine. Then she put half the white pile into the water, leaving a little room at the top. Then she loaded the drawer washer with her underwear. She put the setting back on automatic. The washer whirred to life and told her she had 45 minutes before they had to be put in the dryer.\n",

I got all of the cleaning supplies together out of the closet.  I had a lot of cleaners and also a toilet bowl brush to help scrub the bottom of the shower.  I took all of these things into the bathroom to get ready to clean the shower.  I put the cleaner on the bottom of the shower and then waited awhile for it to work.  After it was done cleaning, I sprayed some water over it to get it to work even better.  When there was a chemical reaction, I looked at it to make sure it was working.

I grabbed the sponge and the dish soap and started with the plates since they take up the most room in the dish drainer. I washed each one and placed them in the drainer when each was clean. After the plates, I moved on to the glasses and repeated the same pattern. I saved the silverware for last as I always keep one cup to hold them all in. I washed each one individually and put them in the silverware bin in the drainer.

After browsing through the frozen food aisle mom and the kids decide to have salmon. Mom pays for the salmon and they get back in the car to go home. When the family gets back home mom takes the fish to the kitchen and decides she is going to broil the fish with lemon. Mom opens the package and rinses the salmon with water in the sink. Mom decides to use the broiler to cook. The broiler is the small area under the oven that usually looks like a drawer. Mom opens it and removes the rack so she can put the salmon on it. A lemon is cut into pieces and mom uses the juice and a few spices to spread over the salmon. Mom places the salmon on the rack then puts the rack back in the broiler. She sets the timer for 15 minutes. When the timer goes off mom uses cooking mitts to remove the rack and fish from the broiler because it is now very hot. The fish cools for a few minutes ten mom puts it on plates for the family to eat.\n",

I put the bottom sheet's elastic corners back on all four corners of the bed. After I got that fixed, I straightened out the flat sheet, pulled it across the whole bed and tucked the bottom of it between the mattress and box springs. I tried to keep the flat sheet even as I placed the bottom of it under the mattress. I pulled the flat sheet up at the top of the bed and made it smooth. Then I put my pillow back inside its case.

The weather on Cape Cod had been cool and rainy but the weekend forecast was beautiful and I was ready for really relax.  As I drove up to my house I saw that the grass was almost up to the front porch!  The following day I woke up and I went for a quick bike ride and then came home and decided to mow the lawn.  My lawn mower was out of gas so I drove to the gas station to get some gas for the lawn mower and I came home and filled it up.

I rolled the paper out and put the box on it. Next, I made sure that the paper was going to fit around the box in all directions. After I was sure of this I went ahead and cut the paper so that I could begin to wrap it. I folded up and taped the top and the bottom sides.

Our teacher wanted us to pick our favorite color and to draw or paint anything we wanted on the wall of our classroom. I picked the color pink and decided to draw my favorite flower along with my favorite quote. I am not the best artist but I really wanted to try my best. The wall was freshly primed and super white, ready for us to paint on it. There was about about one hundred and thirty graduates, so we each had a specific time to take our turn to paint.

When I got home I had to figure out exactly what to move around since my walls are pretty full. I figured out a new way to move pictures around until I had a nice empty spot above my couch. I measured the distance between the two hooks on the back of the painting and put small marks on the wall the correct distance apart. I got my hammer and pounded a nail into the first hole. I used a level to make sure the second nail was level with the first. When I got it perfectly level I pounded the other nail in the wall. I lifted up the painting and lined up the hooks with the nails and slid the painting onto the nails. I stepped back and looked to make sure I liked the placement and ensured that it looked level.

Then I got five forks, five knives, and five spoons out from the cupboard. I placed one fork and one knife on the left side of each plate, and then I placed one spoon on the right side of each plate. Then I got five napkins from the pantry, folded them, and placed one on top of each plate.

He looked online for how to boil milk because he never needed to do it before and he was concerned he was going to do it wrong. So he searched how to boil milk on google and a bunch of different answers came up so he just chose the first one that popped up on the list of different answers. He proceeded to follow the directions to boil milk and the instructions said to boil it in a large pot until it starts to bubble which was easy enough instructions to follow. He continued to stir the milk until it bubbled and then let it boil for around two minutes and took it off the stove and stored it.

We had went and ate some lunch, and went shopping to some stores we had been wanting to go to. Then, completely out of nowhere, one of my friends suddenly collapsed. I checked him to see if he was breathing, but could not feel his breath or a pulse at all. Panicking, I called 911. After letting the receptionist know my location and the situation, they informed me that an ambulance was dispatched and would arrive shortly. Sure enough, the paramedics arrived within minutes and carted my friend off on a gurney. My other friends and I wound up going to the hospital that he was being taken to so we could see him and be updated on his condition. Apparently, he had just fainted, and as it turns out, he would be discharged from the hospital just one day later.\n",

My friend was about to hit his ball when he started complaining of being dizzy.  He put down his golf club and sat on the ground, and then he vomited.  We knew the symptoms of heat stroke and called 911.  They instructed us to move our friend to a shady area and to lay him down with his head propped up.  They told us to cool him down with water, and try to get him to take liquids.  We had to watch him in case he vomited again.  We gave them our location and stayed on the phone with them until help arrived.  We could hear the sound of the ambulance in the distance.  We were relieved to hear that sound.

Once I was sure that the hair was not tangled in any section of her hair, I began to wash her hair by preparing the water. Using the water faucet, I use both the cold and hot controls of the water, and continue to adjust them until the water was warm. Then, my daughter bent over the sink so that her hair could fit under the water faucet. I use the water to wet her hair, ensuring that all of her hair from front to back was completely submerged under the water and wet. Once all of the hair was completely soaked in water, I applied a palm full of shampoo to my hand. I use both of my hands to rub them together in order to create suds with the soap and water. Using my hands covered in shampoo, I applied the shampoo bubbles to my daughters hair all over. I use my hands to massage the shampoo throughout her entire scalp, and showing to cover each strand of hair with shampoo from root to tip, but also ensuring not to pull, tug or yank on the wet hair in order to prevent breakage. Once the shampoo had lathered up completely and covered her entire head of hair, we use the lukewarm water to rinse the shampoo completely from her scalp and hair. Ensuring that there was no residue left over size of shampoo, I rinsed the hair for about two minutes moving from front to back and side to side in a repetitive fashion. Once I was satisfied that all the shampoo have been washed out, I applied a palm full of conditioner to my hand, and rubbing that between the palms of both of my hands. I then applied the conditioner to her hair using both hands, repeating the same process of ensuring that all of the hair strands and scalp was completely covered with conditioner. I even use a second palm full of conditioner and applied a second coating just to make sure the hair was completely saturated with conditioner. I spent about five minutes massaging the conditioner into the scalp and the hair, giving the hair time to absorb the nutrients that are in the conditioner. After that time period, I placed my daughters head underneath the water faucet again so that the running water could rinse out the conditioner. I use my hands to rob the hair and a downward motion to ensure that all of the conditioner was rents from her scalp and hair, but also laying all the hair and a single direction so that it would be easy to perform the next step, which is drying her hair.\n",

The bag is good in that it lets your pick up all the garbage in the can without dropping any of the garbage on the floor. Most garbage bags also have strings on the end you can tie together to keep the bag closed when you want to pick it up. I tie the strings of my garbage bag together, and lift the bag of garbage up out of the can. I place the bag on the ground for me to take out to the dumpster later, and get a new garbage bag out from a cabinet. The new bag is folded up, so I unfold the bag and open it up to let the air inside. After the bag is open and filled with air, I put the bag inside the can and wrap the ends of the bag around the lid of the garbage can. This way the bag does not fall inside the garbage can.\n",

It was an all black Range Rover with blacked out headlights and tail lights. We got in and cruised around the city. It was a smooth drive and the flashy inside made me feel really cool.

I also removed a small baking dish from the cabinet and preheated the oven. While the oven was heating up, I removed the fish from its packaging and put it on a plate. I then covered it with black pepper, garlic, and butter. I then placed the fish into the baking dish and waited for the oven to finish preheating.

I like to feed my cat a mixture of dry and wet food to give her some variety. So the first thing I do is head to the kitchen to see if there is an open can of her food in the refrigerator. If not, then I'll take a can from the kitchen cupboard. Next I'll go to my pantry and pull out a bag of her favorite dry food and mix a little of each into her food bowl. I am careful to measure her food so that she gets just a quarter cup of wet and a quarter cup of dry because I don't want her to be overweight.

Molly was playing with her soccer ball inside, which she was NOT allowed to do and she knew this at the time, but she kicked the ball around inside the house anyway. At one point she went to kick the ball and most unfortunately tripped and fell backwards, accidentally kicking the ball very hard in the wrong direction, causing it to hit the coffee table, bounce off the wall and smash into the TV! This knocked the TV off the stand and cause it to shatter the screen. Mom and dad were very angry at first, but later explained calmly to Molly that this is why she isn't allowed to play with the ball inside the house. Instead of being upset about the incident, Molly's parents got on their computer and shopped for a new and much better TV to buy in place of the broken one.

If all of the standards are met throughout the tenure of this educational course, I may look forward to receiving the coveted \"drivers license\". After a short discussion with my parental unit we reached a conclusion involving what we determined would be best described as a pretest. We drove out to an empty parking lot and I assumed command. My mother explained all the pertinent details of all the control surfaces and how to properly engage them. As I disengaged the transmission and selected a gear, my nerves increased exponentially with the  motors RPM's. When the clutch engaged the transmission the car violently lurched forward. In a fit of fear I panicked and froze up completely stiff. The car lurched 2 more times before succumbing to my insolence. That is how I didn't drive a manual very well.\n",

We made our way down the seven flights of steps from my apartment building and onto the street. The cars and taxis whizzed by as we stood at the curb, our right arms in the air, in attempt to hail a taxi cab. One by one, the taxis ignored us, because they were either occupied or didn't want to stop for us. It was then I took matters into my own hands, and stepped out into the actual street, with my right arm in the air. I spotted another yellow taxi cab and I waved my arm in the air, while standing in the street and making eye contact with the driver. He saw me, and slowly pulled over to the curb. Success! My friend and I got into the backseat of the taxi cab, and told the driver we were headed to Wall Street. We strapped in our seatbelts, and we were on our way. Once we got to our destination, I swiped my credit card in the card reader to pay for the ride, gave him a $5 tip, and we exited the cab to our destination.\n",

They had many blue prints, that architects had drawn to detail what work had to be done.  They followed the plans by taking many measurement to make sure the work they did was correct.  They also had new cabinets and floors tiles and appliances.  They removed some walls while building out others, and laid a new tile floor.  They installed all the new cabinets and ran the water pipes and electricity to put in all the new appliances we got.  They had specifically built the cabinets around the fridge and stove so the two appliances slide perfectly into place.  It took them a few weeks to do but when it was done our kitchen was newer and so beautiful.  It had better windows and more lights and it was easy to get around and cook in it.

But my mom wanted me to so I could learn how to cook, So I decided to get serious and make eggs, she wanted to crack the egg open but very softly claiming too hard would mess things up. Following this I had to put the yellow egg yolk in a bowl and she told me mix and stir it until the yolk was completely dissolved into the rest of the liquids. I asked her what was next and she replied \"Add Salt and Pepper into your mixture\" so I stirred the salt and pepper with it as well and then put it into the pan on the stove and let the egg fry while I chopped it up into small little pieces making myself a delicious bowl of scrambled eggs!\n",

It was very uncomfortable for a few days and the only thing that helped me feel a little better was drinking hot tea. In the pantry in my kitchen I have several boxes of different teas that all come in tea bags. They all have different flavors and smell really good. The first think I did was take a cup out the cabinet in my kitchen and then fill it with filtered water from a pitcher I keep handy. I then put a bag of Jasmine tea into the cup of water and then put it in the microwave oven. It was a big cup so I set the time on the over for 3 minutes on the highest power setting. When the tea came out it was very hot and I had to be careful when drinking it at first. I left the tea bag in the cup for a minute and stirred it up a little. The I took the tea bag out of the cup and threw it away and drank the tea before it got too cool. It made my throat feel better and I stopped coughing for a little bit. I had to keep drinking more throughout the day though until I felt better.\n",

It was kind of stressful to me, especially i didn't want to look like mass. SO I decided to paper the whole room before I start painting. I emptied the whole room completely, and then used the papers those I saved when I moved. Those were big so it was easy to handle and they were quite sturdy and firm. I started with one side of the wall, and I covered each space by arranging them next to each other, and overlapping them, so it doesn't leave any space in between. Then I put the tape where I overlapped them so while walking on it, will not move them from its space.I made sure that it was secured on the edges, specially on the area which was close to walls. It was good to go.\n",

In the morning, I brushed my teeth as I normally do, but I also brushed them right before I went to the appointment. When I got there, I checked in and gave the receptionist my name. Soon after, they called me to the first room, where did they X rays. This was not the most fun thing in the world, but it wasn't long and soon after they started to clean my teeth. The process didn't last long, but it was still annoying. They scraped at my teeth and cleaned them, before finally flossing them. Finally, as the last step, the actual dentist came in and quickly took a look at my teeth before I left. This process was quick and easy and then I got my toothbrush and left.\n",

I remember him opening the door and the first thing I saw was a giant T-Rex standing right above me!  I gasped when I saw it and my dad laughed at how excited I was.  We went up to the counter and he paid.  We walked through the museum and listened to the talking TV's that told us about each of the dinosaurs.

My cousin and her boyfriend were getting married, and we were anxiously waiting in the sanctuary of the church to watch the ceremony.   Finally,  elegant music started playing, and I watched as my grandmother was escorted down the aisle of the church to a front row seat that had a reserved sign on it.  Then the soon to be groom's grandparents were also escorted down the aisle in the same way.  The bride and groom's parents came down the aisle next and made there way to the front of the church where a several candles were on display.  The couples parents both lit a tall candle that on both sides of a larger candle called a unity candle.  Once the parents were seated, the preacher and the groom walked from a side door at the front of the church on to the stage.  The preacher took his place at the middle of the church while the groom stood to the side and nervously stared to the back of the church waiting to see who would be entering next.  When the music changed, the back doors of the church opened and the bridesmaids and groomsmen started walking in pairs slowly down the aisle arm in arm.  The bridesmaids dressed in a flowing blue dresses and held a bouquet, and the groomsman were dressed in tuxedos with blue flowers in sticking out of their lapels.  They walked to the front of the stage and took their places on each side of the stage.  A cute little girl with a basketful of flower petals walked down the aisle sprinkling petals along the pathway.  The flower girl was adorable, as was the little boy ring bearer, who carried a small pillow with rings tied to them.  The music changed again to the Bridal March song.  Everyone in the church stood and faced the back door of the church.  As the doors opened a second time, the Bride stood there in a beautiful white satin sparkly gown and white see through veil that covered her face.  Her hair was styled in a braided updo and had little flowers peaking out of her braids.  She held on to her father's arm as he walked her down the aisle to meet her groom.  When they got to the front the father placed her hand in the grooms and took his seat with the bride's mother.  The preacher greeted the people at the church and talked to the bride and groom.  He said some nice things about love and asked the couple to exchange their vows.  The Bride and groom took turns repeating things that they had written about how they promised to love each other and be faithful forever.  The preacher asked the couple one at a time if they wanted to take the other person as their bride or groom.  Both the Bride and the Groom said, \"I do\" .  Then they exchanged wedding rings as a symbol of their love.  The groomsman who was the best man, and the bridesmaid that was the maid of honor had been holding the rings for safe keeping.  Once the rings were exchanged, a soft song was played and the couple went to light the unity candle.  They each took the long candle that their parent had lit, and used it to light the big candle in the middle.  This represented them leaving their parents home and starting a new life together.  When the song ended the preacher had the couple face the church and kiss.  Everyone cheered as they were introduced as the newly married Mr. & Mrs Smith.  It was a very happy moment followed by a dinner in the reception hall where we watched the couple share cake, have their first dance, and greet their guest.  Later the groom threw a garter to a group of single men, and the bride threw a bouquet to the single ladies in attendance. The couple that caught the bouquet and garter had their photo taken together. The bride and groom then got ready to leave.  We all gathered in front of the reception hall with a handful of bird seed.  Someone drove the grooms car up to the sidewalk so that the couple could make a quick get away.  The groomsmen had decorated the car in funny sayings and balloons. The car's bumper had streamers with cans tied to the ends.   When the bride and groom ran to the car, we threw the bird seed at them.  As they drove away,  the cans on the streamers were dragging and rattling behind.  It was a fun day that I'm glad we got to be apart of.\n",

It was rush hour, so the gas station was pretty busy.  I saw an open pump and pulled up alongside it.  I pulled a lever to access the gas cap and stepped out of the car.  I walked inside and told the cashier my pump number, and put $20 towards filling up my tank.  I walked back through the warm evening air and unscrewed the gas cap.  I put the nozzle to the whole and pulled down on the lever.  $20 filled up most of the tank, and the pump made a noise to let me know that it had stopped fueling.

I ordered the wallpaper and when it arrived, I got to work.  Fortunately very few tools were necessary.  I had a pan to wet the wallpaper, which activated the glue on the back, and a brush to smooth it out.  First I set a plumb line, which involves a putting a light weight on a piece of string and putting the string in some chalk.  I put it in the center of the first wall I was going to paper to make sure I had a straight line.  I put the paper into the water to activate the glue.  Then I hung the first strip to be straight down the chalk line.  I smoothed out the paper, then repeated with the next strip.  I continued to do this until the entire room was papered.  It was a full day of work but it looked amazing!\n",

Then I cook it for a minute and a half on high. When it beeps, it is perfectly cooked and steaming hot. I smear on a spoonful of pickle relish and a line of mustard, and eat up every bite. The trouble is, this way of cooking a hot dog is not reliable. Some brands of hot dogs have cold spots when they're cooked this way. With some brands of bun, the roll will come out overcooked and spoiled. I think different hot dogs and maybe different microwaves don't work the same way. This means that anyone who wants to make a quick microwave hot dog has to experiment a bit. I did, and I have perfected my technique.\n",

My mom took me inside, and when they called my name, we went back to a room where a dental assistant greeted us and cleaned my teeth before doing the actual extraction of my front two teeth. I saw her prepare the numbing agent so that I wouldn't feel the actual procedure. I was scared. When she attempted to put the injection around my gums, as a knee-jerk reaction, I bit her finger. She was really unpleasant about it. I mean, it was an accident, I was scared, and I was scared. So instead of attempting to numb the area again, she just pulled out my teeth with a pair of pliers while I screamed. She had me then bite on some thick gauze and lay back in the chair. I was given my teeth in a small, pink treasure chest and sent on my way. I don't like going to the dentist anymore.\n",

I thought maybe I would rent one from a movie store. Most movie stores are gone now though, but you can still rent from a small kiosk in different places. I drove to the nearest store that had a red movie rental kiosk. I thought about which kind of movie I wanted to see. Using the touch screen at the kiosk I looked at all the different movies that could be rented. Movies that were sold out at the time were grayed out, and could not be rented. I looked through all the different titles and selected the movie I wanted. The kiosk asked me for my credit card and I slid it through the card reader on the side. I entered my zip code and pin number, and finished paying for the movie. The kiosk then gave me the movie from a slot, and I took it home to watch.

After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around. So I wanted the picture to have the big tree as the main subject. I took my camera out of the bag, turned it on, and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo. I made sure the whole tree came out, so I stood far back.

I got my large cutting board off of the shelf and washed my best sharp knife. I started with half of a red onion. I chopped it up into small pieces. Then I chopped half of a green bell pepper. Next I chopped up a whole red bell pepper. Since the red bell pepper was so much smaller than the green bell pepper, I decided to use the whole thing rather than just half.

I closed the pantry door and went to the refrigerator to get a package of ground beef. I set it on the counter. I put a large frying pan on the stove and turned the heat to medium. I added the ground beef to the pan, crumbling it into smaller pieces. While it cooked, I filled a large pot with water and put it on high heat on another burner.  I stirred the ground beef with a wooden spoon while I waited for the water to boil. When it boiled, I added the long pasta noodles to the water in the big pot. I covered it almost all the way with a lid, but left a crack so that the water would not overflow. When the ground beef was brown, I turned the heat down to low under it. I opened the jar of sauce and poured the whole thing over the ground beef. I stirred the sauce into the meat and let it cook for several minutes. I pulled the lid off the spaghetti noodles and pulled one out with a fork to see if they were soft. They were almost ready, so I got plates out of the dish cupboard and called everyone to dinner. Then I  turned off the stove and drained the pasta.  I put a serving spoon in the sauce and a large fork in the pasta. Everyone served themselves.\n",

Since my parents don't like spaghetti, though, I only made enough to feed my younger brother and I. The first thing I did was prepare the meat. I cooked some ground beef in a pan, and drained the grease when it was done. Then, I added the sauce to the meat, and let it simmer in the pan for a few minutes. While this was simmering, I took out a box of uncooked spaghetti noodles and emptied it into a separate pot of boiling water. The noodles eventually all became soft, and once I noticed they were properly cooked, I emptied the pot into a strainer. The strainer is a special dish with holes in it, which make sure that the dish catches the hot pasta, and the water goes down the drain. Now that both the sauce and pasta were done, I put the pasta on plates, poured sauce over it, and called my brother over for dinner.\n",

Hours later, when I get up, make my coffee, and eat my breakfast, I walk out to the end of my driveway to bring my newspaper inside. I love to read about the daily occurrences around town and all over the world as I start my day. Reading the paper each morning makes me feel very informed. After I've brought the paper inside, I open it up and read the first page, then flip to whatever stories I find most interesting that day. Sometimes there's an important event around town that I'm interested in, sometimes there's a sporting event that I'd like to know more about, and other times, I open and flip right to the puzzles section to find my favorite thing in the newspaper, the crossword and sudoku puzzles.\n",

I cleaned the floors using a sweeping motion, making sure to check in the corners, behind the couch and chairs, and under the rug for dirt and dust.  I swept all the dust into a pile in the middle of the room.  I used the broom to sweep the pile of dust into the dust pan.  I carried the full dust pan to the garbage, and emptied it into the garbage.  Then I took the broom and dust pan back to the closet, and hung them back on their hook.  I took the garbage out of the garbage can, tied up the strings, and carried it outside to the dumpster.  I opened the dumpster, placed the garbage bag inside, and then went back inside.

It was a little square box that had a rectangular slot on the bottom. Emily hollered I know how to work this I used to have one in my room!  She plugged it into a plug in and then turned it to channel three. She then looked at me excitedly and said do you have any VHS tapes?! I said I think I do and told her to come into my moms room. We opened up my moms trunk at the end of her bed, and looked in at her movies. Here's the titanic, yuck Emily said.

I got her a phone case that had lights built into the case, and it was supposed to be the perfect case to take a picture of yourself, since the lighting was so good. I was so excited about the gift that I'd found that I forgot it needed to be wrapped before I could give it to her! I went down into our basement storage room where my family keeps all of our wrapping paper for everyone's birthday and holidays. I picked out some funny wrapping paper with cats on it since my sister really loves cats. I sat down on the floor of the storage room with my paper, scissors, tape, and my sister's gift, and began wrapping. I cut a piece of paper about three times the size of the gift and placed the gift in the middle to fold the paper around it. I folded in the ends and taped everything together. I was proud of the job I'd done, since I'd never been very good at wrapping gifts. Finally, I put a pretty pink bow right in the middle of the gift because that's my sister's favorite color.

Since I live in an apartment I have to go either to a laundromat or use the washing machines in my building which are very small and expensive so I went to the laundromat. Some of my laundry I do not put in the dryer because I prefer to hang it to dry so it doesn't shrink. When the rest of my laundry was dry I stuffed it into my bag and basket to fold it at home and not spend any more time than I needed to in the laundromat. When I got home I dumped all my clothes on the bed and put Netflix on TV so watch while I folded. I didn't have a system of what to fold first, I just grab whatever is closest and make piles as I fold. I fold all of my t-shirts so they can be lined up in my drawer that I can see the design on every shirt rather than putting them in a pile. My pants get folded in half and then over again so they are in a square and fit nicely in the drawer. I fold my underwear in half and then in half again. My socks I don't fold, I just put them in a pile by matching pair and lay them in the drawer. Sweatshirts get hung up in the closet. I took my time since I was watching Netflix while I was doing it.\n",

I did not want to go out there, because he seemed very angry and I thought might yell at me too. So I called 911. A nice woman answered the phone. She said, \"What is the nature of your emergency?\" So I told her that a man I did not know was scaring a woman who lived next door to me. She asked me my address, and I told it to her. Then she asked me if I thought the man had a weapon. I said I thought he didn't. She told me not to worry, that the police were on their way. Then she stayed on the phone with me, asking me questions like how old I was and where I went to school. Very soon, I saw a police car pull up in front of my neighbor's house.

First we removed the old carpet and pads underneath and disposed of them in a dumpster. We then put down a kind of paper that protects the flooring underneath. We also had to remove baseboards before putting down the hardwood. We began to lay the strips of wood along the wall, making sure to place each piece together tightly. Sometimes we had to use rubber mallet to do this part. We also used a table saw to cut the pieces of hardwood to the right sizes after measuring and marking them when necessary. After laying out all of the hardwood pieces, we replaced the baseboards and swept the floor to remove any dust or debris. We touched up paint on the white baseboards as well.\n",

Today like normal, the newspaper man arrived around 1pm and delivered the newspaper by putting it into the mailbox just for the newspaper.  It is right next to the regular mailbox.  After school, John hops off the school bus, and checks the mail for his dad, and also checks for the newspaper.  He gets the mail, and the newspaper, and brings the mail to the house.  John loves to do this for his dad because he knows his dad is busy, and it is a sweet thing for him to do for his dad.  His dad comes home at night after work, and sits down in his favorite chair, and checks his mail that John left for him on the table.  He then reads his newspaper and drinks his coffee.

I opened up the dishwasher and began taking the clean dishes out. I started with the top shelf of the dishwasher because the clean cups and glasses are always the easiest items for me to remove. I removed each clean glass and cup one by one and carefully put them neatly stacked in the kitchen cabinet above my head. I walked over to the cabinet I store my pots and pans in and opened it up for easy access and began unloading my big cooking pots that I had used the night before to cook with.

When it started to boil I put some cinnamon for flavor, and 2 teaspoon of loose tea. I prefer loose tea which is made on stove rather than microwave. I let the tea boil for at least 5 minutes. Once I could smell the flavor of tea, I know it's ready. Then I added 4 teaspoon of sugar. I stirred it well. I turned off the stove, got the big mug, and poured tea through sieve.

      " 1390).Last year my husband and I attended a community theater production of “Man of La Mancha”. It was held at a very nice modern theater that is part of a community center in a nearby town. I enjoy the music in “Man of La Mancha” very much. I found out about the production in our local newspaper. The play started at 8:00 p.m. and since there were no reserved seats, we left early. We drove in our car to the theater. We arrived at 7:30. We purchased our tickets at the box office. They gave us a program which contained a lot of information about the play, the actors and production crew, and the community theater company in general. We read that program until the play started. When the lights went down in the “house” (which is what they call the audience part of the theater, where you sit), an orchestra began to play. The orchestra was on the floor below the stage and immediately in front. The music at the beginning is called “the overture.” They played the overture for about five minutes. Then the curtain went up and the play began. The show consisted of several acts, and at least a dozen songs. There was some dancing, and as this was a play about Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, the two main characters rode “pretend” horses which were like boxes around their waists but you could see their legs underneath. “Man of La Mancha” is a funny story with a sad ending because Don Quixote (really the author Miguel de Cervantes) goes to prison. There was an intermission in the middle of the performance where they stopped the action, put the lights on in the “house” (where the audience sits), and we went out into the lobby of the theater to buy a Coke. After intermission, we went back into the theater to see the rest of the play. We knew the play was over when the stage curtain was lowered for the final time. The curtain did go up again, one more time, as the actors came out onstage and we applauded them. We had also applauded them after every song during the play. Then the house lights went up for the final time, we left the theater, got into our car and went home. In the car on the way home we talked about how much we liked the songs.\n",

We both dressed nicely but it was in a church with no air conditioning and it was hot outside so I wore a sleeveless dress and sandals. We were seated on the groom's side of the church with some other friends who we chatted with before the ceremony started. The music started and the groom and his groomsmen walked in and stood at the front. The bridesmaids walked down the aisle and the music changed, everyone stood and the bride walked down the aisle with her father. The ceremony was a very quick exchange of vows, the couple kissed and the pastor announced them as husband and wife. Everyone clapped and the bridal party walked back the aisle.

So, once all the dirty dishes were on the counter in the kitchen, Jessie, would stand at the soapy side of the sink , and start to wash dishes.  Then she would hand it over to Dan, who rinsed the dishes with cool water, and placed them in a drying rack.

We decided to go camping in the Boundary Waters in the north of Minnesota, and that we would canoe from campsite to campsite. Once we did that, we started to pack. We needed tents, sleeping bags, hiking boots, clothes, water bottles, and enough food to get us through our week. We packed our hiking backpacks and drove up north to the beginning of the trail. We spent five days canoeing through the Boundary Waters of Minnesota, stopping at a different site every night to set up our camp and eat dinner. When we got to a campsite, the first thing we would do was pitch our tent and make a fire so we could start cooking dinner. My favorite dinner that we made was campfire macaroni and cheese, with s'mores as a dessert. Our five days flew by and suddenly it was time to go back home.

Next I removed the flat sheet, making sure I pulled the sheet completely off.  Finally, I removed the fitted sheet.  I decided I wanted to wash the pillow sheets too.  Nothings better than feeling soft new sheets on your pillow when you go to sleep! Once I pulled off all of the sheets, I placed them in my laundry basket.  Just as I was about to start putting on the new sheets I had taken out of my closet; my dog, Waldo, jumped up on the bed!  Before I could put the new fitted sheet on the bed I had to pick up Waldo and put him on the floor.  After that was done, I pulled my purple fitted sheet over each corner of the bed.  I made sure all four corners were completely covered.  I even pulled the ends of the sheet under the bed, to make sure they wouldn't come loose! Next, I took the flat sheet and spread it across my bed.  At the foot of my bed I made sure to tuck in the corners of the sheet, so it wouldn't come off in the night.  Finally I a pillow in each one of my pillow sheets, and placed them onto of the bed.  The only thing left to do was to put the quilt on top! After that was finished, I made sure everything was neat and tidy and that the quilt was on straight! Finally I could go to sleep!\n",

I started by picking up all the clothes that were on the floor and furniture. I threw them in a hamper and carried them down the hall to the laundry room where I started them in the washer. Then I ran around the flat collecting dirty dishes. I loaded them into the dishwasher and pressed a button to make it start. I looked around the living room. Still a mess! I pulled a trash bag out of the cabinet and collected all the paper, junk mail, and old food cartons and soda bottles that I had left out. I filled the trash bag and set it near the door to take outside later. When my dog barked, I remembered that I should vacuum as well to get rid of the fur all over the carpet.

I was with my wife, who has always thought I was a good dancer, and honestly, she is terrible so in comparison, I knew I'd look OK. We ended up going to a place named Bongo's because my friend said it was laid back and had a good atmosphere that wasn't too young or too old. Right away, I felt like an old man because everyone there was so much younger than us. After getting out onto the floor, I didn't care about anything other than having a good time with my friends and wife. We had a great time and even learned some new dances from our friends and new friends we met.\n",

Tomatoes grow really well in my climate but peppers are hit or miss. I turned the earth by hand several times over a week, picking out weeds, roots and rocks each time. Eventually the earth was soft and aerated close to 10 inches down. I raked the dirt one last time and lined the edges with stone. I made rows of dirt for each vegetable and small mounds for the cucumbers. I poked holes where each seed would be planted following the depth and spacing  guidelines on the seed packets. I then dropped one seed into the corresponding hole for each row and covered them over. I lightly watered the whole garden, stepped back and imagined what it would look like three months from now.\n",

To start, I like to gather all of my ingredients and have them ready. I need two eggs, two tablespoons of milk, a ¼ teaspoon of salt, a dash of pepper, and a ½ cup of filling that includes shredded cheese, chopped spinach and onion, and cubed ham chunks. Next, I beat the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. I beat it until it’s mixed really well. I heat the butter in pan until it melts, and then I pour in the egg mixture. It cooks really quickly, so I have watch closely.  Once the egg starts to thicken, I add in the filling to one half of the omelette. Then I use a spatula to flip over the other half, covering the filling. I cook that for about a minute, and then flip over the entire omelette and cook briefly on the other side. Then, I slide it onto a plate and I'm ready to eat.\n",

I thought chips and salsa as well as pizza would be nice, so I called a pizza shop to put in my order ahead of time. I went to the store to buy chips and salsa. Then, the day of my party, I cleaned the entire house by organizing everything and vacuuming the floor. I then set out all of the food and waited for my friends to start arriving.

She took my order and told me it would take about 15 minutes to cook our food. After 15 minutes had passed, the waitress served me my steak dinner. I thanked her and we went away to help another customer at another table. I took my knife to cut my steak into smaller pieces to eat. When I cut the steak open, it was very pink and raw inside. I knew that this is not what I had ordered so I waited until the waitress was nearby so I could get her attention. She came over to my table and asked what she could do for me.

Next I narrowed down my choices, I couldn't afford to go to Mexico, or to Las Vegas. That left a beach trip or a camping trip. I decided I wanted to go to the beach to enjoy the sun. I thought about getting a plane ticket, but the beach was close enough to my house that I could drive and save some money. I looked on the internet to find a hotel near the beach that I could afford.

The tennis court is a flat place with a net across the middle. To play tennis, we hit a ball back and forth at each other using big net paddles called rackets. If you don't hit the ball back when it's hit to  you, or if your opponent hits it so it goes outside of the court, you score points. Scoring in tennis is very different than in other sports. When you score once, you get fifteen points. When you score again, you get another fifteen points, so you have 30 points. Score a third time, you get 10 points, giving you a total of 40. If you score again when you have 40 points, you win the whole game!\n",

First of all, you want to make sure that the light switch is turned off so that you will not burn yourself.

After making sure that it is, you should try to turn on the light and see if it works. If it does work, you can be sure that you put the light bulb in properly.

After getting home, it would be time to fold our laundry.  I poured all of the clothes out onto the bed.  After I did that, I got each piece of clothing and started to fold it.  I would tuck the arms of the t-shirts behind the body of the shirt and fold the pants in half.  To stay organized, I put them in piles after being folded so they would be easy to put away.  When they were folded into piles, I would make sure I wasn't missing anything.  I looked around to make sure there weren't any clothes that were hanging around.  There weren't, so I put the clothes away in their drawers in the piles.\n",

I asked her mother for a list of people she would want invited and then I went to the store to pick out invitations.  I looked at several different invitations.  I liked the pink polka dot ones and the blue glitter invites.  I decided on the pink polka dot initiations because my friend's favorite color is pink.  When I got home I filled in all of the information about the party. The party was going to be in one week at my house.  I made sure to let everyone know it would be a surprise party so my friend wouldn't find out about the party by accident.  I put a stamp on each of the envelopes and addressed the invitations.

I was so excited to go as my kids loves too. We prepared our bag as we decided to stay there for whole day. We packed our swimming suits, towels, sun glasses, goggles, snacks and I decided to buy sandwiches from fast food restaurant. I made sure that I had sun screen lotions. We walk up around 8:30, and did good breakfast. Nothing to hurry because it opens at 10:00, and i do not want to go in cold pool. If it is heated, it will be much better. IT was half an hour drive from our home. This swimming pool has some slides and little water park beside it. We left our home at 10, and reached at 10:25. This is good day as temperature was in 90's and no clouds or raining. Good news. We Bought our passes and entered around 10:45. We swam, and took break for lunch.There were not so many people, so it was good space for us to do the things. My kids dive and went in to deep water. We had so much fun. I hope to go again there.\n",

I pulled out my ironing board and set it up in the utility room.  I grabbed the iron and plugged it in.  While I was waiting for the iron to get hot, I arranged my shirt on the board.  Once the iron was completely hot, it was time to start.  I ran the iron over the shirt slowly enough to press the wrinkles out.  I couldn't go too slow though.  Going too slow would leave burn marks on the shirt!  It took me a few minutes but I finally finished ironing the shirt.  When I was through, I carefully hung the shirt on a hanger.  I walked over and unplugged the iron.  I waited until the iron cooled off.  Then I put the iron and the board away.\n",

I remove all the items from the shelves, including soap, shampoo and any other bottles. I place these items on the sink next to the shower. Next I spray the faucet, shower head, and shelves with the foaming cleaning spray. I let that soak in for awhile. Then I spray the tile and glass door with the bleach cleaner. This disinfects the surfaces, and also removes any mildew. I let that soak in. I take my sponge and wipe down the faucet, shower head and shelves. Then I rinse my sponge and wipe the faucet, shower head and shelves again to remove the foam spray. Next I scrub the door and the tile with my sponge, making sure to remove any mildew or built up soap scum. I rinse my sponge again and wipe the door and tile one more time to make sure the bleach is removed. Next I will run the shower and splash water on all surfaces, to double check that all the cleaning sprays are thoroughly rinsed off. Now my shower is clean.\n",

I went into my garage where I kept my lawn mower.  I tried to start it, but it wouldn't work!  I had no gas.  I drove down to the gas station on the corner and bought a couple of gallons of gas for my mower.  After paying for the gas, I put the tank back into the bed of my truck.  Then, I drove home.  I poured all the gas into the tank of my lawn mower.  Then I climbed into the seat.  I turned the key and it started!  I zoomed around my yard, happily clipping my unsightly grass.  Afterward, I rolled the mower back into the garage and turned it off.  Then, I took the key from the ignition and hung it on the rack. The grass looked great!\n",

The task has been difficult but we have had fun accomplishing each task. This week we have to lay down all the floors in our house. I hired a contractor to do all the flooring in our home. We had everything taken out of the rooms and all the old carpet was stripped. I picked a beautiful maple wood flooring to go in the whole house. The contractors have been hard at work for a couple of days,  installing each plank of wood at a time. After the floor is laid out in one room ,they cover it with brown paper and start another room. The loud banging of the floors being installed can be heard throughout the whole house. After a few days, they finished the floors and it came out just as I imagined.\n",

Every Sunday, I start by cleaning out my shower, I spray all the walls with a foaming cleaner, and wipe them down. I then clean the toilet, which is my least favorite part, because I think it's gross. Using toilet bowl cleaner, and a toilet brush, I scrub around all the inside of the toilet, let it sit for a little while, and flush. It turns the water a weird blue color. I wipe off all the surfaces of the sink, the toilet, and the cabinets with a wet towel and bleach spray, and mop the floor. Afterwards, my bathroom is shiny and clean, and I feel better in my house knowing I have a clean, nicer-smelling bathroom. I can spend the day knowing my chores are done, and have some time to relax.\n",

To begin cleaning the bathroom I always start with the  tub because it is the biggest surface to clean.  First I sprayed the bleach cleaner into the tub and then I let it sit for a few minutes.  After a few minutes I scrubbed the tub until it was sparkling clean.  After the tub I sprayed the same solution into the toilet and scrubbed the toilet with the scrubbing brush.  I then scrubbed the sink and the faucet until they were shining.  Next I sprayed the mirror with Windex and cleaned that until it was as clear as could be.  My last step in cleaning the bathroom is scrubbing the floor.  I used my swifter wet jet and sprayed the solution and scrubbed the floor until it was completely clean.  Once one bathroom is done I do the exact same process to the second bathroom.\n",

I always buy my groceries all at one time for the week and then cook everything over the weekend so that I do n't have to cook on a daily basis . Anyway , I hopped in my car and drove to Walmart which is where I usually do all my grocery shopping . I found a parking space close to the entrance because I knew I was going to buy a lot . I got out of the car , walked through the store doors , and grabbed a shopping cart along the way . I made my way down the fruit and vegetable aisles first , picking up bananas , oranges , salad mix , and kale along the way . I then added some fish , chicken , hamburger meat , and pork to my cart . Moving along down the aisles , I picked up all the dairy goods , spices , and snacks I would need for the week . With my cart stacked high , I headed to the check out line where the cashier greeted me warmly and began ringing my items up . My total came to $ 101.43 which was a lot of money but definitely worth it . The cashier bagged my groceries as I paid . Then , I pushed my cart full of groceries out of the store and to the parking lot where I would load them into my trunk . I put the cart in the cart holding area and drove away . \n",

I list what I plan to cook this week , and also cleaning products and similar things . My favorite place to shop is a huge membership store , for its good prices . I pick up a shopping cart just outside the store . Then I enter , sometimes showing my membership card to the person at the door and sometimes getting in without showing it . I cruise past the impulse items just inside the door , and through the electronics and organic foods sections that come next . Next come many aisles with items like light bulbs and pillows . Finally I get to the food . There are usually people here offering samples of new food items . I often take some . I buy large packages of chicken or fish that can be frozen . Sometimes I buy fresh bread . I continue to the fresh fruit and vegetable section , where I try to restrain myself to what I can use . Next come the chiller and frozen foods , but I go past hem to pet food and paper goods . I get frozen food on the way back , and then a few canned food and dry goods . The last areas are pharmacy , which I mostly avoid , and the book section , where I 'm apt to linger . Then I wait in line for a while , pay , and leave the store . As I leave , someone checks my cart , to make sure what 's on my receipt matches the huge load I am carting home . \n",

The bag barely fits because my garbage can is overflowing. I push the items on top further down, so that everything can fit. I realize it is time to take of the trash. I pull on the two colored drawstrings on each side of the garbage bag and close the bag. Then, I proceed to tie the drawstrings like I would when tying my shoelaces. I then lift the garbage bag out of the garbage can and walk to my front door. I open the door and continue out to my driveway to where my trash can sits outside. I lift the lid of this trash can and put my garbage inside. The trash removal crew will come and take this trash later this week; I just have to leave it here for now.

It was a tiny one bedroom, one bathroom apartment with a small kitchen, dining room and a decent sized living room. There was only one closet, a very large walk-in closet in the bedroom. Put simply, there just was not enough storage space, so everything ended up piling up on the floor. Laundry, both clean and dirty ended up in a basket or on the floor because there was no room in the closet. When we moved out we spent two or three days cleaning the place. Cleaning isn't that hard, it's just determination. So, we each picked an area of the apartment and just started. We threw away everything we could live without and stuffed clothes in to garbage bags to take them to the laundry mat. We scrubbed dishes and put them away and then scrubbed down the counters once everything was off of them. We shared the worst job in the place, cleaning the bathroom.\n",

I reached there at 6:30, then I had to park my car, because it was my personal car. So I rented the space by Ramada Inn. I took shuttle to airport. My family was waiting for me there, so I did not have to worry about luggage, that I already dropped it off at airport. Once I went inside, My family were already in line for check in. It was big but they were in line already so, it saved my lots of time. It took, i think about 1/2 hour for me to get on to station. She checked my bags in. They were in right limit for weight. All went though without any trouble. They put the labels on each and every bag, even the carry on. I put special marks of ribbon my all bags so it can be easily recognized. I was so much relieved.

I felt that it was important to finally changed the sheets and so I finally did it. I started off by pulling off the bed sheets completing and putting my pillows to the side. I then took the sheets and put them in a basket. Following that, I took them downstairs and put them into the washer. After putting  detergent on them, I set the washer to begin and started washing them. Soon after, I put them in the dryer and then took them back upstairs.

I add salt and olive oil to the water even though Margaret says it doesn't do anything. it's habit, so I like to do it anyway. Once the water is boiling I add the pasta.

So I put those pillows properly on the bed. Then I got my blanked from my closet. I unfolded my blanked and applied evenly on the bed.

I ended up choosing a romantic comedy and my husband chose a sci-fi fantasy movie. We carried the empty display cases to the circulation desk, where the worker was sitting.

I paid for the order and was given my receipt. We then waited at the counter for our food to be served. Upon receiving our food, we got additional items we needed: napkins, condiments, etc. We found a table and ate our meal. When we were done, we cleaned up and left.\n",

Once I was ready, my boyfriend drove to my apartment to pick me up. We decided to go to a nice restaurant that serves gourmet pizza. At the restaurant we looked at the menu and decided what kind of pizza we wanted to eat. I got a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and my boyfriend ordered a Hawaiian pizza with pineapple. While we were waiting for our food to be made, we talked to each other about our day and what we did. We also talked about a TV show we both like and made suggestions for new TV shows we think that the other person might enjoy. Then our food was finished being cooked and was brought out to us. We ate our pizzas and shared with each other. It was so delicious. Once we were done, the waitress brought us our bill and we paid for our meal. My boyfriend drove me back home where he gave me a goodnight kiss and we parted ways.\n",

It is important for me to remember to visit with all my older relatives, because since they don't get out often, they sometimes become lonely. So I try to take something for them so that after the visit is over, they will still have something to remind them I was there. I wanted to take flowers from my garden to plant at her house, but it was too hot to do garden work because the temperature was 95 degrees out. So instead I took her a case of her favorite soda to drink every day so it would remind her of me, and cool her off from the heat. She lives an hour away from me, and it is a long drive. I was tired when I got there, so we just sat outside on her porch and drank sodas. I talked about lots of stories of people we both know from when I was younger. Older people like to be reminded of stories of things that happened long ago, so I told her about how my sister Brenda had once made my grandma  laugh when she bought everyone in the family cheap little silly presents for Christmas. I said my grandma thought it was so thoughtful of my little sister to want to make sure everyone got a present, even if it was something little and cheap and silly. Somehow, talking about Christmas and drinking a cold soda made us suddenly not feel so hot in the 95 degree weather. I said goodbye and promised to visit this weekend, and the drive home didn't seem to take so long because I kept smiling thinking about the stories we told.\n",

It was a truck, his dad's truck. So, when he got there, the instructor asked him to buckle up, and they drove off in the truck going regular speed. The teacher asked him to do several things, like take a turn left, turn blinkers on, stop, go, change lanes, all these things.  Roger had to do each thing carefully, while was checking for other cars around him.  He made sure he did not go too fast, and he did do all his turns well. He did not hit any other cars.  The one thing he did not do was turn off the lights at the end of the test.  He got back into the car and turned off the lights, and then locked the car in the end. The teacher was happy with his driving and passed him.\n",

We got in our cars and looked up how to get to the beach on my phone.  We drove over there as the sun was setting.  We got out our swimming suits, changed into them, and got out towels to sit on.  We brought our baby to go take pictures with us on the beach.  She didn't like the water very much, but we had fun.  We sat on the towel and watched the sunset.

After deciding, we asked the attendant for two tickets to that specific movie. She told us the total, and we paid it all. She gave us the tickets and we went inside. There we walked up to the concessions stand and ordered popcorn and a soda. After we paid there, we took our tickets up to the man waiting to tear them. He tore both tickets and told us where to go for our movie, and pointed in the direction. We found our theater by the number above it and following what he had said.

A few minutes later we were there, grabbed a newspaper, and went to the cashier to pay. On the way back I gave my toddler the cartoon section to look at. He smiled at the colorful pictures.

But because I buy gifts for children at Christmas, I like to wrap them so they have the fun of opening them. In order to wrap a gift I first eyeball how big the package is. Then I pull out that amount of paper from the roll and cut it with scissors. Then I fold the paper around the gift. I'm not very neat with it because the kids don't care and are just going to tear it all apart anyway. Then I take tape and tape the edges off. Sometimes I get fancy with the folding of the paper, but usually not. I then repeat this process for all of the other gifts. If I'm feeling particularly generous I'll throw a bow on top of the gift too, with a card as well.\n",

I also pour myself a glass of ice water to sip on while I 'm soaking . I go and grab the latest magazine that I 've been waiting to read and put it next to the tub . Once the tub is filled , I climb in . I start by washing my face and then my hair . After my hair is washed , I put a deep conditioner in my hair . Now , it 's time to relax . I let the conditioner sit while I read my magazine and sip some water . After 15 minutes , I rinse my hair out and then wash my body with soap .

This would give me enough time to check in, pass through security and find my plane. I arrived at the airport and parked my car in the parking garage. I placed my parking slip on the dashboard, locked the car and went inside the airport. I walked to the check-ins section of the terminal. After finding the right desk, I stood in line to wait to be served. The airline worker took my information and checked my bag.  The bag was placed on a conveyor that led to the airplane.

I turned on the hot water an felt around for its temperature. Turned on the col water to get it to the right temperature. Then I wetted my sponge with some soap on it and started scrubbing some of the gunk off the dishes. It makes you wonder why we do this before loading the dishwasher. The entire point of having a dishwasher is to wash dishes. But I'm washing the dishes. I should be able to just load the dishwasher with dirty dishes with all the gunk on it, and it should wash them clean. That's the whole point of it. But that's not going to work. because the jets of water isn't strong enough to clean dried up gunk off the dishes. I've loaded the dishes into the washer, and put some soap in it, and closed the door and hit the clean cycle. I have to take them out once they're finished and dried.\n",

We were planning for picnic whole day, so we wanted to make sure we use our time wisely. we shared the work, so we do not get overwhelmed. I decided to get chicken ready for barbecue, and bread and sauces. My friend told us that she has big grill so she will bring it with her, and she will bring drinks and snack items along with paper plates, napkins and fruits. We planned to leave early, as the drive was 2 hours from our house. The place we were going was by the beach, and they had good park for us to barbeque and eat. The best thing they had , good clean beach, so we all prepared swimming suits and extra clothes to change, towels, and soap.

I took my toddler, Alex with me, we brought along some toys, snacks, and sunscreen, and off we went. The temperature was in the eighties, and it was bright and sunny, but being so far north, the water was too cold to swim in. We decided to play in the sand instead. Together we built a large sandcastle with a moat that allowed water to flow in. We threw a ball back and forth, watched boats, and ate some snacks. After we went for a walk on the long pier at the beach, Alex rode nicely in his stroller. By that time, we got tired out, went home, and took a nice, long nap. We have a great time whenever we go to the beach.\n",

So when I got off work today I ran to grocery store and picked up a few food items I needed for our meal. She had to work late today which gave me plenty of time to prepare my meal for her. Once I got home from the grocery I began by defrosting the frozen sausage in the kitchen sink (filled the sink up with warm water). As the sausage was defrosting I grabbed a crock pot from the kitchen cabinet and placed it over the kitchen stove and turned the knob on the stove to \"high heat\". I quickly grabbed my measuring cup and measured out 2 1/2 cups of warm water and dumped the water into the crock pot. As I was waiting for the water to boil in the pot, my sausage that was defrosting was now ready to be sliced in smaller pieces. I grabbed a cutting board from a cabinet and a chef's knife from the knife rack and began slicing the sausage into smaller serving sizes. Once I finished cutting the sausage, I dumped it into the boiling pot of water and also added the jambalaya rice mix into it. I let the sausage and the jambalaya rice boil for about 5 minutes before turning the stoves heat down to let the contents simmer for 25 minutes. The jambalaya was ready after 25 minutes of simmering on the stove.\n",

I look at my recipe book to see what I should do with them. Then I turn on my oven to preheat it. I spray a baking dish with cooking oil, then put the four chicken thighs in the dish. I select some different spices and sprinkle them on top of the chicken: salt, oregano, and thyme. The oven beeps when it has preheated to the right temperature, and I put the chicken in without covering it. I turn on a timer for a half hour. Now I have to decide what to serve with the chicken. Potatoes? I take some red potatoes out and wash them in the sink. I poke holes in them with a knife and then put them in the microwave oven. I cook them for about ten minutes overall, but I wait so that they're finished when the chicken is ready, after a half hour in the oven. When the alarm I'd set goes off, I take the chicken out and take the potatoes out. The food is ready to go on a plate. I'll add butter and salt to the potatoes to make them delicious.\n",

I cannot drink my coffee straight yet, I have to add some sweet things to take away the bitter taste. So I add a small amount of milk and about two teaspoons of sugar.

I went down to our freezer where we keep all of our fish and grabbed a big salmon. I brought it back up to the kitchen and began to prepare it. Before I started preparing the salmon, I preheated my oven to make sure it would be ready to go. I butchered the salmon and cut it into pieces for us to eat. After the salmon was prepared, I seasoned it with salt and pepper, and wrapped it in a parchment packet to go into the oven along with some lemons, a sprig of rosemary, and asparagus.

Sure enough , there was a small puncture , I must have run over something sharp while commuting home . I then went to the local bike shop and the man at the shop recommended that I buy a patch kit , since doing so is much cheaper than replacing the entire tube . The patch kit was very easy to use as the instructions were very details . First I added glue to the area and then put the patch on top . After holding the patch in place for a few minutes , I added a little talc . I also added a little talc to the inside of the tire . Once everything was set , I put the wheel back on the bike and everything was good as new . \n",

The wall he wanted to paint is very tall, and his wife wanted to paint it red.  They call this an accent wall because it accents the room.  Only one of the walls will be red, and then the others are white like normal. The red wall is the accent wall.  So, Jose and I started by putting a drop cloth on the floor, so we would not spill any paint on the carpet. Next, we used tape to cover the edges of the wall doors and molding, so the paint would not cover those spots.  Then we pulled out the paint cans, and the paint rollers, and started to paint the wall.  It was so red! We had a lot of fun making sure that the whole wall was covered.

I usually just go to whichever local salon is closest , and I do n't have a regular person who usually cuts my hair . I only like to spend about $ 15 each time I go . Today , I decided get a faded haircut . The nearest place only charges $ 10 , so I was pleased with that . The lady who helped me was named Sarah , and she talked a lot about the weather and how much she wanted to be outside . She also asked me a lot about my job , and it turns out her husband also works where I work . The haircut took about 15 minutes and she did a pretty good job . It 's just the right length and she cut the back of my hair the way I like most . I paid her $ 10 and tipped her $ 5 . I left completely satisfied . \n",

I went to my desk and picked out pink stationary.  I sat down and wrote a long letter, detailing everything that I had been up to over the past few years.  I told her how I married my college sweetheart and about our three kids: Kate, Brian and Brook.  I told her how I accepted a teaching position at the high school and how we had just put in a new pool.  I made sure to include my address in the letter so she could send me a letter back.  I put the letter in an envelope, and carefully wrote her name and address on the front of it.  Then I put a stamp on it and put it in the mail box to go out the next day.\n",

Once I mixed all of the ingredients together I put them in a pan and into an oven and set the oven to 400 degrees . I put the cake into the oven and set the cooking alarm for 12 minutes . Once the cake was fully cooked and the cooking alarm rang I took the cake out of the oven and let it cool off for a couple of minutes . After those couple of minutes were up I took some frosting after taking the cake out of the cooking pan and onto a plate , which just happened to be chocolate , and spread it over the cake lightly with a butter knife . Once I had completely covered the cake in frosting I put it gently into a box and put it into the fridge until I wanted to eat it . Once I ate it tasted really very good . '' , Nice Task Thanks\n",

After he is undressed he stands next to the tub and giggles and dances watching the running water create a mass of bubbles ! I make sure the water is warm enough , because his baths tend to last a bit longer than most . When the water is ready , he throws in all his tub toys , lizards and dinosaurs , cups and cars . The cars are his under water taxi 's for the fish , he says . He sits amiss the bubbles playing with his toys and laughing . We do the toe test , which is when i look at his toes and if they are wrinkle then time is up . Yup toes are wrinkled , he laughs as wash his body and hair . I let the water out as he sits there and waits for the tub to empty , only then does he want to get out . He helps to dry himself off and put his pajamas on . Now it is time for bed . \n",

Bobby comes rushing down because he has been starving since 6:00P.M. Bobby sets down the table mats on the table, he grabs the plates, bowls, and spoons and places everything on the table. Mom brings out the main entrees and dad brings out the drinks. Steam is coming out from the freshly cooked garlic shrimp dish that dad prepared. A bowl of broccoli and carrots on the side, and some iced tea to complete the meal. Mom says, \"Don't forget to get the napkins for everyone!\" Bobby gets up grabs the napkins for everyone, so when everyone is chowing down, they have something to wipe the delicious sauces all over their faces.

Thinking about what type of painting I wanted, I went to the closest home goods store to see what paintings they had available. It took some time, but I eventually picked out a painting that I liked more than the other ones there, along with some wall hangers. After bringing the painting home, I picked out a spot for it on my living room wall that I liked. I then used a hammer to put the wall hangers into place. Once I made sure that the hangers were perfectly lined up, I hung up the painting and stepped back to get a better look at it. It looked perfect, and I was incredibly happy. After this, every time someone steps into my living room, they feel it much more lively than before.\n",
